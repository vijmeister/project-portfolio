• Worked in a group of three and predicted /classified type of crime in the SF Bay area using a large dataset (1 million observations). Utilized elements of time and location (latitude, longitude)
• Used Naive Bayes (train error 33.9) and Random Forest (train error 33.5) in YARN and then scaled up RF in AWS. Found 8 vCPU is optimal size, yielding a rapid response time: under 1 minute
• Specialized in using and tuning the Random Forest algorithm, scaling up our program and visualizing results
