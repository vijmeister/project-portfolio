Used R and Python to predict the outcome for animals staying in a shelter (adoption, died, euthanasia, transferred, returned to owner).
• Grouped animals of similar colors and breeds together
• Evaluated feature importance and selected the top 5 features using Random Forest algorithm (has name, time of day, month, animal type, gender)
• Employed Decision Tree and K-nearest Neighbors algorithms, achieved 66% accuracy in training dataset
