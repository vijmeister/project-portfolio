Worked in a group of three using Python to classify the trip type (out of 38 possible types as defined by Walmart) of a large dataset- approximately 600,000 observations of items scanned. The features of interest are the following: ScanCount, Weekday, Department, and Item count. The provided data was summarized in a pivot table and then fit and predicted using a voting method of random forest, Bagging of KNN, and Bagging of CART. 6 trip types were predicted with an accuracy greater than 70 percent; this information can be used to provide customized incentives to these customers. Created the preprocessing program and was active in choosing the classification model and ensemble method to use.
