Bernie Sanders begins making case to Hillary Clinton’s superdelegates,2468,"Bernie Sanders at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on Sunday. (Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters)Bernie Sanders held a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Sunday to mark one year since launching his presidential bid, vowing to take his fight for the Democratic nomination to the superdelegates currently supporting frontrunner Hillary Clinton.“It’s a tough road to climb,” Sanders told reporters at the National Press Club, but “not an impossible” one.In a scene reminiscent of the sparsely attended, April 30, 2015, press conference on Capitol Hill where he formally announced his run, the Vermont senator said that those superdelegates supporting the former secretary of state ought to rethink their pledge — particularly in states where he won handily.“I would ask the superdelegates to respect the wishes of the people of those states,” Sanders said.Overall, Clinton has the support of 520 superdelegates, while Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, has “all of 39” — despite winning 17 primaries and caucuses “in every part of the country.”Sanders pointed out that although he won Washington state’s Democratic caucuses by 46 points (73 percent to 27 percent) and 25 of the state’s 36 pledged delegates, Clinton has the support of 10 of Washington’s Democratic unpledged superdelegates.“We have zero,” he said. “Obviously, we are taking on the entire Democratic establishment.”Sanders on Capitol Hill after announcing his run for president, April 30, 2015. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)Clinton’s lead over Sanders in pledged delegates is 1,645 to 1,318.“Let’s be clear,” Sanders said. “It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14 — the end of the primary season — with pledged delegates alone. She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, it will be a contested convention.”He urged the superdelegates to consider which Democratic candidate would have the best chance of winning in November. And “based on virtually every national and state poll over the last several months,” Sanders said, that would be him.“I would be the stronger candidate,” he said, noting that it “would be a disaster if Donald Trump or some other rightwing Republican were to become president of the United States.”Sanders also said superdelegates should consider the youthful enthusiasm he’s injected into the Democratic Party, drawing a total of more than 1.1 million people to his rallies and a record 7.4 million individual campaign contributions — statistics that Sanders says prove his nomination would not only secure the White House but also help Democrats win down-ballot races in the fall.“The energy and excitement in this campaign is with the work we have done,” Sanders said. “This is an important reality that superdelegates cannot ignore.”Which is why the Sanders campaign is prepared to take its case — and its message — through the presidential primaries in California and Washington, D.C., in June and to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.Sanders began the press conference noting that last year on this date, he trailed Clinton by at least 60 points in national polls. Now, the Vermont senator said, he’s nearly pulled even with Clinton in many of those same polls — even leading her in some.“When we started, we were considered to be a fringe candidacy,” he said. “That was then, today is today.”And while Sanders reiterated to reporters that he would do everything in his power to stop Trump from becoming president if he ultimately loses the Democratic nomination, he was in no mood to talk about his campaign’s “legacy.”“I hope my legacy will be that I was a very good president,” Sanders said.At that 2015 press conference to announce the launch of his presidential campaign, Sanders was even more bullish.“We’re in this race to win,” he said."
Malia Obama to attend Harvard in 2017 after a ‘gap year’,8224,"President Obama and daughter Malia walk across the South Lawn of the White House, Aug. 23, 2015. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP)President Obama’s eldest daughter, Malia, has made a decision about where she will attend college. And she has chosen Harvard University.Malia, who is due to graduate from high school next month, will enter Harvard in the fall of 2017, the White House said Sunday. She will take a “gap year” before beginning her freshman year at the Cambridge, Mass., school, the Obamas said.Malia had visited at least a dozen elite public and private colleges, including Columbia (where President Obama earned his bachelor’s degree), Princeton (where first lady Michelle Obama earned hers), Brown, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, New York University, Stanford, Tufts, Berkeley, Barnard and Wesleyan.Both Michelle and Barack Obama are graduates of Harvard Law School, Michelle in 1988 and Barack in 1991. As an undergrad, President Obama attended Occidental College before transferring to Columbia, where he graduated in 1983.Last fall, the president said he wasn’t pushing Malia in any particular direction.“One piece of advice that I’ve given her is not to stress too much about having to get into one particular college,” he said during a town hall on college affordability in Des Moines, Iowa, in September. “There are a lot of good colleges and universities out there. Just because it’s not some name-brand, famous, fancy school doesn’t mean that you’re not going to get a great education there.”The president and Malia Obama boarding Air Force One in Los Angeles last month. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)“[That’s] assuming that Malia will listen to my advice,” Obama added. “She’s very much like her mother at this point. She’s got her own mind.”The 17-year-old is a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., where she has lived since President Obama began his first term in the White House in 2009. Earlier this year, the president said he turned down an invitation to speak at Malia’s graduation because he’s is going to be too emotional.“Malia’s graduating in June. I can’t talk about it,” Obama said at a luncheon in Detroit in January. “They’re going to leave their daddy. It’s shameful!”The president with Malia. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)The president added: “I’m going to be wearing dark glasses … and I’m going to cry.”The White House, though, won’t be an empty nest, even if Malia decides to leave home during her gap year. Sasha, the Obamas’ youngest daughter, is three years away from graduating high school.At the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner on Saturday night, Obama said he and Michelle won’t be leaving Washington immediately, as other presidents have.“We’ve decided to stay in D.C. for a couple more years,” Obama said. “This way, our youngest daughter can finish up high school, Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots.“The Obamas walk across the South Lawn of the White House. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP)The first daughters have largely been kept out of the public eye during Obama’s presidency, appearing alongside their parents at official White House gatherings (like the annual turkey pardon) and shuffling across the South Lawn to board Marine One for family vacations.But last year Malia did score an internship on the set of HBO’s “Girls” in New York City, where she was spotted all over town — with her Secret Service detail in tow.Harvard is used to having students with a presidential pedigree. According to the New York Times, Malia Obama will be the latest in a long line of first children to have attended, including “[John Quincy Adams’ son] John Adams II; Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert; the sons of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt; Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy; and George W. Bush, who went to business school there.”And Harvard encourages incoming students to take a “gap year” in order to gain real-world experience before entering college. And in doing so, it may take at least some of the spotlight off Malia’s freshman year.“When you’re a presidential has-been, the rest of your life you’re famous, you’re a target, you’re in a security bubble, but it’s not the same,” presidential historian Gil Troy told the Times. “The kids can get to at least some level of irrelevance that they absolutely cannot get when they’re still in the White House.”"
"‘Obama out’: The best, worst and most awkward moments from the 2016 White House Correspondents’ Dinner",3344,"President Obama delivered what will be his final White House Correspondents’ Association dinner speech as commander in chief on Saturday night, as celebrities, politicians, Beltway insiders and the White House press corps were toasted and roasted at the annual black-tie gala. And it seemed no one — inside or outside the Washington Hilton — was off-limits.Below, a roundup of some of the best moments from the so-called “nerd prom” — including plenty of presidential zingers.Hillary Clinton was Obama’s first target, with the president poking fun at a controversial skit his former secretary of state recently participated in with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.“I do apologize — I know I was a little late tonight,” the president said. “I was running on C.P.T., which stands for ‘jokes that white people should not make.’”Obama then turned his attention to the Democratic frontrunner’s paid speeches.""If this material goes well, I’ll use it at Goldman Sachs next year,” he said. “Earn me some serious Tubmans.”And, later, Clinton’s difficulty with younger voters.“I’ve said how much I admire Hillary’s toughness, her smarts, her policy chops, her experience,” Obama said. “You’ve got to admit it, though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed up for Facebook. 'Dear America, did you get my poke?’ 'Is it appearing on your wall?’ 'I’m not sure I am using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.’”Obama made several jokes about Bernie Sanders, who was in attendance Saturday.“We’ve got the bright new face of the Democratic Party here tonight — Mr. Bernie Sanders,” the president said. “Bernie, you look like a million bucks. Or to put it in terms you’ll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of $27 each.""A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people,” Obama continued. “But not me. I get it. Just recently, a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man.”Obama added: “I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you’ve distanced yourself a little from me. I mean, that’s just not something that you do to your comrade.”The president used one of Sanders’ adopted campaign slogans to zing Clinton once more.“Bernie’s slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people,” Obama said. “'Feel the Bern’ —  it’s a good slogan. Hillary’s slogan has not had the same effect.”A graphic displayed on the screen showed Hillary’s logo pushing a boulder up the side of a mountain next to the phrase “Trudge Up the Hill.”“Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well,” Obama said. “Glad to see that you feel that you’ve earned a night off. Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process — it’s all going great. Keep it up.”There was, however, some confusion among Republicans over the WHCD invitations, the president said.“Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan,” Obama said. “That’s not an option, people. Steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish, but that’s your choice.”Halfway through his speech, the president skewered the elephant not in the room: Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who intentionally skipped this year’s White House Correspondents’ dinner.“I am a little hurt that he’s not here tonight. And it is surprising. You’ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no?  Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What’s he doing?""There’s one area where Donald’s experience could be invaluable,” Obama admitted. “And that’s closing Guantánamo — because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.”“I think we can all agree that from the start, he’s gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy,” Obama said. “I hope you all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost, and now we’re praying that Cleveland makes it through July.”The Comedy Central comedian and host of Saturday’s dinner berated CNN, MSNBC and Fox News.""Speaking of drones, how is Wolf Blitzer still on television?” Wilmore asked. “Ask a follow-up question. Hey, Wolf. I’m ready to project tonight’s winner: anyone that isn’t watching 'The Situation Room.’""I’ve been watching CNN a long time,” he continued. “Yep. Used to watch it back when it was a news network. … I don’t know about you guys, but I can’t get enough of that CNN countdown clock. Now we can see exactly when they hit zero in the ratings.”“Not to throw any shade, but Fox News is the highest-rated cable news channel among viewers who have no idea what 'shade’ means,” Wilmore said.Comedy Central star Larry Wilmore roasts the government and the media. (Photo: Yuri Gripas/Reuters)And MSNBC, Wilmore said, now stands for “Missing a Significant Number of Black Correspondents.”“Am I wrong? They like fired Melissa Harris-Perry, they canceled Joy Reid, they booted Touré,” Wilmore explained. I heard they put Chris Hayes on probation because they thought he was related to Isaac Hayes. That’s wrong. MSNBC got rid of so many black people I thought Boko Haram was running that network.”“Some of America’s finest black journalists are here tonight,” Wilmore said. “Don Lemon’s here too. Hey, Don, how’s it going? Alleged journalist Don Lemon, everybody.” (Lemon gave Wilmore the finger, which was shown live on television.Wilmore even skewered C-SPAN.“C-SPAN, of course, is carrying tonight’s dinner live, which is ironic because most of their viewers aren’t,” Wilmore said. It’s true, guys. C-SPAN is the No. 1 network among people who died watching TV and no one’s found them yet. No, but it is good to be on C-SPAN. Glad I’m not on your rival network, ‘No input, HDMI1.’”Obama laughs during the White House Correspondents’ dinner in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. (Photo: Yuri Gripas/Reuters)“The office has taken its toll on you,” Wilmore said. “I mean look at you! Your hair is so white, it tried to punch me at a Trump rally. The president’s hair is so white it keeps saying, 'All lives matter.’""You came in here looking like Denzel. Now, you going out looking like Grady from 'Sanford and Son,’” Wilmore said. “I know it’s a dated reference, but you’re dated, Mr. President.”“Eight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now,” the president said. “I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days till my death panel.“Hillary once questioned whether I’d be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call,” he continued. “Now I’m awake anyway because I’ve got to go to the bathroom. I’m up.”“Standing here, I can’t help but be reflective, a little sentimental,” the president said. “Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific.”President Obama hugs Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who spent 18 months in an Iranian prison. (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP)There were some serious moments too. President Obama paused to pay tribute to Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter who was freed earlier this year after spending nearly 18 months in an Iranian prison.“Our free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Rezaian,” Obama said. “Last time this year, we spoke of Jason’s courage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year, we see that courage in the flesh, and it’s a living testament to the very idea of a free press and a reminder of the rising level of danger, and political intimidation, and physical threats faced by reporters overseas. And I can make this commitment that as long as I hold this office, my administration will continue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their will — and we will not stop until they see the same freedom as Jason had.”President Obama offered a thinly veiled prediction on the 2016 presidential race.“Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot,” he said, “and it’s anyone’s guess who she will be.”The president ended his WHCD speech with a nod to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who ended his NBA career with an on-court speech with a similar “mic drop.”“I just have two more words to say,” he said. “Obama out.”The president concludes his speech with a final goodbye and a mic drop.

Jokes and jabs: Obama attends final White House Correspondents’ dinner,563,"President Obama on Saturday will put on a tuxedo and make his way to the Washington Hilton to attend his last White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in office, symbolically celebrating reporters who pick apart his policies, strive to hold his administration to account, and press his frequently reluctant White House for greater information, transparency, and access.“Tonight reminds us that we really are lucky to live in a country where reporters get to give a head of state a hard time on a daily basis — and then, once a year, give him or her the chance, at least, to try to return the favor,” he said in 2014, referring to the tradition of presidents ribbing the press in remarks at the dinner.When Obama gets behind his lectern on Saturday to give his speech, no one will be safe. Whatever he might think of the annual gala event itself, Obama has clearly relished the opportunity to roast all kinds of targets from the worlds of politics and celebrity and, of course, his hosts, the news media.About 2,620 people, including representatives from 105 media outlets, will pack tables of 10 in the hotel’s main ballroom at the sold-out event, held annually under the auspices of the White House Correspondents’ Association since 1920.The WHCA is best known for the dinner. But the organization’s chief mission is to defend the interests of reporters, whether they’re pushing for more opportunities to question the president and his top aides or helping to manage the intricate logistics of media coverage when the president is traveling. (Disclosure: I am on the WHCA board.) The dinner includes the awarding of scholarships to student journalists and prizes given to reporters in recognition of their work the previous year. WHCA President Carol Lee of the Wall Street Journal will give a speech on the importance of a free press. And the professional entertainer on Saturday will be Larry Wilmore, host of “The Nightly Show.”But the headline act will be Obama, who has everyone wondering how he will top previous outings. It was just last year, after all, that he told the crowd that he had a “rhymes with ‘bucket’ list” of things to do in his last months in office.In years past, the standup-comic-in-chief has mocked Hillary Clinton’s controversial use of a private email server, MSNBC’s audience size, Chris Christie, Senate Democrats fearful of losing reelection, the Secret Service, CNN’s Ebola coverage, Ted Cruz, Martin O’Malley, Bernie Sanders, John Boehner, Fox News, his drop in public opinion polls, and the botched roll-out of Obamacare — as well as people who say he was born in Kenya, or that he’s a secret Muslim.And then there was Donald Trump. White House aides never fail to put  Obama’s skewering of the bombastic developer and reality star in 2011  among the president’s favorite Correspondents Dinner moments. It came after the release of Obama’s long-form birth certificate, an effort to quiet the false rumors that he was born outside the United States and might be ineligible to be president, a fiction that Trump eagerly promoted.Here’s what Obama said:“Donald Trump is here tonight! Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald. And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?“But all kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience. For example — no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ at the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team cooking did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so ultimately, you didn’t blame Lil’ Jon or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. Well handled, sir. Well handled.”Say what you will about Mr. Trump, he certainly would bring some change to the White House."

"Protests force Trump into a ditch, en route to make his California pitch",5033,"BURLINGAME, Calif. — A little over a month before California’s pivotal Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump began his official wooing of party delegates Friday, headlining a kickoff lunch at the state’s annual GOP convention.But Trump’s appearance was nearly derailed by massive protests outside the Hyatt Regency hotel, where the convention is being held. More than a thousand protesters blocked surrounding streets, and at one point, knocked down police barricades as they attempted to storm the building before Trump’s speech.The protests also blocked the candidate’s motorcade route, forcing him and his Secret Service detail to abandon their vehicles on a nearby highway, jump a barricade wall and cross a ditch to get to the hotel’s back entrance —movements that were captured by television news helicopters.“That was not the easiest entrance I’ve ever made,” Trump said when he finally took the stage nearly an hour late. “We went under a fence and through a fence. … It felt like I was crossing the border actually.”Trump joked about wiping dirt and mud off his suit as he prepared to meet a roomful of nearly 600 California Republicans — including many who will be on the June 7 GOP primary ballot as delegates to the national party convention in July. “You guys got to come in through the lobby,” he said. “I come in under a fence.”Donald Trump waves to supporters after a speech at the California Republican Convention on April 29 in Burlingame, Calif. (Photo: Stephen Lam/Reuters)The speech came just hours after massive protests erupted outside a Trump rally Thursday night in Costa Mesa in southern California, where at least 20 people were arrested and a police car was smashed by anti-Trump demonstrators.On Friday, Trump downplayed the violence, pointing out there had been no protesters inside the Costa Mesa event, which attracted at least 8,500 people.Addressing the party faithful here, Trump took yet another victory lap for his spate of recent wins and mocked his rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for sticking in the race even though, he said, they have “no path to victory.” Kasich, he said, was acting like a “spoiled child” for staying in, even though he still had fewer delegates than Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dropped out last month. And, in what sounded like a greatest hits of Trump insults, the real estate mogul also went after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who suggested in a television interview Thursday that he could never back Trump, his former GOP rival.“Like I care,” Trump said in response, describing Bush’s appearance on CNN as “low energy, very low energy.” Slideshow: Scenes from the California Republican ConventionNot to be harsh, Trump added, he didn’t really need the support of any of his GOP rivals because “it’s not going to have any impact on whether or not I beat Hillary Clinton.” But, Trump insisted, “the rest of the party has to come together.” “There has to be unity in our party,” Trump said. “We have to get together as a party, because it’s a tougher road for a Republican than a Democrat.”While he predicted the Republican race would “come to an end very soon,” Trump asked supporters to campaign here for him ahead of the state’s GOP primary, where polls show him leading Cruz by more than 20 points. “The world is watching,” he said.As he exited the stage, Trump joked that he’d have to climb under a fence again to escape the protesters who continued to surround the building. Nodding to the Secret Service agents who stood guard around the stage, Trump said, “You have no idea the route they have planned for me.”"
Scenes from the California Republican Convention,28,"Several hundred protesters opposing Donald Trump gathered Friday outside the hotel where he was scheduled to speak to California Republicans, and a large contingent of police sought to head off violence like what followed a rally in Southern California the night before.A man wearing a Trump campaign “Make America Great Again” red cap was struck while being jostled by a group of shouting protesters.“It went gangbusters. They attacked me,” said Chris Conway, who identified himself as mortgage broker from San Mateo.A dozen protesters linked arms to block the road in front of the hotel near San Francisco International Airport, but no one was using the street because police had already closed it to traffic. Protesters also draped a large “Stop Hate” banner outside the hotel. (AP)Here’s a look.Find more news-related photo galleries on the Yahoo News Photo Tumblr!"
"Unconventional #8: Trump kick-starts his California campaign, why Carly won’t help Cruz (and more!)",57,"Unconventional is Yahoo News’ complete guide to what could be the craziest presidential convention — or conventions — in decades. Here’s what you need to know today.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally on April 28, 2016, in Costa Mesa, Calif. (Photo: Chris Carlson/AP)Costa Mesa, Calif. — Donald Trump had a California-centric script with him Thursday night when he strode onstage at the Pacific Amphitheatre to the rapturous cheers of supporters who have waited months for their man to return to the Golden State.Then he chose to throw it out — literally.“This is out of a book,” Trump said at one point, quoting from a sheaf of talking points. “‘No state in America has suffered worse from open borders than the state of California. Its impact on jobs, wages, security, schools, hospitals, has been devastating.’ We know that. We know that.”A few minutes later, Trump made a show of discarding the printout.“We gotta get this crap outta here!” he shouted, tossing the papers on the ground.Instead of sticking to the libretto prepared for him, presumably by his slick new guru, Paul Manafort — instead of behaving “  so presidential you will be so bored  ” —in Costa Mesa Trump delivered one of his roughest, most raw and rambling performances to date. He painted illegal immigrants as murderers. He highlighted his hard-line views on torture. He mocked his rivals, past and present. He repeated a  widely discredited  tale about General Pershing shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.And all the while, he barely talked about California.After the event, a standoff on the streets outside the Pacific Amphitheatre between dozens of police and hundreds of protestors — mainly young, local Latinos — turned violent. Rocks were hurled at passing motorists; the front window of a police cruiser was smashed. Approximately 20 people were arrested. One Trump supporter’s face was bloodied.The question now is whether the sort of inflammatory, scattershot style on display Thursday in Costa Mesa will help Trump win the crucial California primary on June 7 or whether his opponent Ted Cruz’s more disciplined, tailored approach will prove more effective. If Cruz does well in next Tuesday’s Indiana contest, the only other true tossup left on the calendar, it is a question that could determine whether Trump will reach the magic 1,237-delegate mark before Cleveland — or whether all hell will break loose at the convention.On paper, discipline seems like the smarter strategy. Only 10 of California’s whopping 172 delegates are awarded to the statewide winner; 159 are divvied up among the winners of each congressional district. It’s a system that rewards organization and focus.As Mike Schroeder, a former state GOP chairman who’s now running Cruz’s California campaign, recently told Unconventional: “This is very blue state. So we’ll have some districts with only 5,000 Republican voters. I call them ‘empty districts’: maybe 2,000 voters will decide the result. That’s not even a good-sized city council race. And yet you still get the same number of delegates — three — that you would in a district with 240,000 Republicans.”There was little evidence on Thursday, however, that Trump has thought about how to win California.Last September, for example, the California GOP  voted to soften its stance on immigration  in direct response to Trump’s harsh rhetoric, revising the party platform to say that Republicans “hold diverse views” on “what to do with the millions of people who are currently here illegally.”Despite that, Trump’s rhetoric on immigration only grew harsher in Costa Mesa; he even opened the rally surrounded by activists carrying photos of family members killed by illegal immigrants.“We don’t care about illegal aliens,” said one father. “Americans first. That’s why Donald Trump is here.”On terrorism, Trump went further, repeating the dubious Pershing story and claiming that Pershing’s actions deterred terrorism for “42 years” — up from 25 years in an earlier telling. He then criticized Cruz for not embracing waterboarding.“He’s actually a very weak person, so he didn’t like it,” Trump said. “I’d go many steps further than waterboarding — many, many steps further.”At times it seemed as if Trump were about to touch on the uneven California economy, which is the top issue, by far, for state Republicans. “Apple is going to start making their product here,” Trump said at one point. “They don’t know it yet, but you watch.” But then, just as quickly, he would digress into an extended riff on how Cruz is a “lyin’ son of a gun” or how he himself is “so good at this stuff.”The closest Trump came to a discussion of the issues facing California was to praise the nearby Trump National Golf Club and joke that he would rather be there than in Costa Mesa.“In Palos Verdes, I have the great club,” Trump said. “I was just there. I would have stayed there a hell of a lot longer, but I had to come talk to you people.”Donald Trump greets supporters after a rally on April 28 in Costa Mesa, Calif. (Photo: Chris Carlson/AP)On stage, the tinsel-haired mogul did not sound particularly interested in the intricacies of California’s voting process and professed ignorance as to why his campaign had scheduled Thursday’s event so far in advance of the June 7 primary.“You’re allowed to write it in, send it in — I don’t care how you do it,” Trump said. “But we haven’t even gotten to California. I don’t even know why the hell I’m here.”Trump’s math left something to be desired as well.“We have 31,000 people here tonight,” Trump said. “That must be some kind of record.”The official capacity of the Pacific Amphitheatre: 8,500.Maybe none of this will matter. Maybe Cruz’s superior organization and focus won’t be enough to carry the day in California; the latest Golden State polling gives Trump  an average lead of more than 17 percentage points  . Maybe all he needs is more attention.He certainly knows how to get it. Near the end of Thursday’s rally, Trump took one last look at the script resting on the podium in front of him.“In Los Angeles, homicides are up 10.2 percent,” he recited. “Rapes are up 8.6 percent. Aggravated assault is up 25.7 percent. What the hell is happening?”The crowd started to chant: “Build the wall! Build the wall!”“We’re gonna build that wall, folks,” Trump responded. “I know what’s going on. I know what’s going on.”Outside, the protests raged._____In general, Unconventional tries to steer clear of YouTube ads released by super-PACs; if you repost these videos, you’re basically promoting — for free —messages that the candidates and their supporters were too stingy to spend money on.But we will make an exception for New Day for America’s recent John Kasich ad.

Picking a vice-presidential partner is a regular and ritualistic part of the nomination process.But unlike pretty much every other person in U.S. history who has chosen a vice president, Cruz is not yet his party’s presidential nominee — and the odds are, he never will be.The maneuver could backfire as a result.( Read the full story .)“This selection seems to violate the norms followed by presidential candidates of both parties, which have usually produced able running mates and have helped elevate the office,” says Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in vice presidential history.It’s no mystery why Cruz felt compelled to jump the gun: to get the media talking about something other than his devastating losses in Tuesday’s eastern primaries and his dwindling chances of capturing the Republican nomination.It’s also no mystery why Cruz felt that Fiorina was his best veep option (even though, unlike Kasich or Marco Rubio, she doesn’t come with any delegates). She’s an outsider in an outsider’s year, a woman in an election that could turn on women voters, a former Californian in a primary contest that may come down to California and an able attack dog, which every modern vice president must be.Still, pre-announcing Fiorina as his running mate is a perilous move for Cruz. It may strike voters not yet sold on Cruz as presumptuous. It would certainly limit Cruz’s leverage at a contested convention, where the vice president slot can be a powerful bargaining chip — perhaps the only one with the power to propel a second-place candidate past the 1,237-delegate mark in later rounds of balloting. And even as a messaging maneuver, it may not produce the desired effect.“It seems like a last-ditch, desperate move,” Goldstein tells Yahoo News. “The vice presidential selection sends messages about the selector. To choose someone who is not really an A-lister after an apparently truncated search does not send reassuring messages about Sen. Cruz’s appreciation of the role of the office or his decision-making approach.”If the press treats Cruz’s premature decision as cynical and desperate, it could spell trouble. As Goldstein notes, “not since 1936 has a running mate had zero years prior experience as a senator, high executive official, governor or member of the House of Representatives. That lack is particularly glaring in that Sen. Cruz himself lacks as much experience in those positions as most presidential nominees.”Fiorina has other vulnerabilities as well, including her role in HP’s troubled merger with Compaq, which led to some 30,000 layoffs, and the fact that she lost the only two campaigns she has run, in this year’s presidential primary and for the Senate in 2010. Trump will surely harp on both.Only once in U.S. history has a candidate dared to select a running mate before clinching the nomination. The year was 1976. The candidate was Ronald Reagan. The former California governor was running neck-and-neck with incumbent President Gerald Ford at the time, and his hope was that Richard Schweiker, a moderate U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, would soothe fears about his Western conservatism and flip some unbound and middle-of-the-road delegates, especially from the Keystone State, in the weeks before the convention.Instead, Reagan’s choice enraged conservative delegates, who were still angry about Ford’s veep selection two years earlier: moderate Nelson Rockefeller.Reagan won more popular votes than Ford — and a far larger share of the delegates than Cruz will — but he still (barely) lost the nomination. Cruz’s decision to announce his VP pick much earlier than Reagan — long before the end of the primaries and months before the convention — is a sign that the Texan is in even worse shape than his hero was four decades ago. It is unlikely that Cruz can succeed where Reagan failed._____(Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Julie Jacobson/AP)In his latest must-read, Yahoo News National Political Columnist Matt Bai explains why neither Cruz nor Kasich will be able to capitalize on the odd cease-fire they jointly announced Sunday — because, more than anything else, “it’s an admission that they haven’t asked Republican voters to choose any real direction for the party other than to stop Trump from becoming the nominee.”Read the rest of Matt’s column at the link above, then drop him a line on Twitter (@mattbai) and let him know what you think. Would a more focused message have helped Cruz or Kasich? Was it ever possible to make the GOP primary about something other than the Donald? If so, how?__________Presidential candidate Ronald Reagan wears a lei as he and his running mate, Sen. Richard Schweiker, appear before members of the Hawaii delegation at the GOP National Convention in Kansas City, Mo., in August 1976. (Photo: AP)The press has reacted to Ted Cruz’s premature running-mate gambit — and its obvious goal of changing the media narrative around his campaign — as an unprecedented show of political cynicism.But Ronald Reagan did it too.As we noted above, Reagan tapped Pennsylvania Sen. Richard Schweiker to be his vice president three weeks before the 1976 GOP convention — even though Reagan was trailing incumbent Pres. Gerald Ford in the delegate race at the time.Usually Reagan’s decision is depicted as a delegate grab, and that it was. But it was also a savvy bit of media manipulation. In the interregnum between the end of the 1976 primaries and the start of the convention — when the delegate hunt was at its most heated — the Reagan campaign learned that Walter Cronkite and his team at CBS had done a careful count of more than 2,100 delegates and were prepared to report that Gerald Ford had won over enough of them to clinch the nomination. In 1976, about 55 percent of Americans watched CBS News. Reagan needed to change the subject — so he picked Schweiker.The plan worked. Cronkite threw the story out.“Everybody was forced to play from a new deck of cards,” Reagan biographer Craig Shirley has written. “The issue of delegates was secondary. The first order of business was to keep Reagan’s campaign alive for three weeks and the selection of Schweiker did this.”Of course, Reagan still lost the nomination (even though it was hardly the end of his political career)._____For the latest data, make sure to check the Yahoo News   delegate scorecard and primary calendar."
"Who made Trump? It was the voters, not the media",228,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photo: Getty Images; video stills: MSNBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, FOXIt’s a question that will be pondered for as long as there are political scientists and media analysts: What caused the rise of Donald Trump?In a story for Politico, former news anchor and correspondent Campbell Brown wrote that she blames television news for the success of Trump’s candidacy. This has been a common debate among people in the media over the last few months, as Trump gets closer to winning the Republican nomination. One theory put forward is that by simply giving Trump so much airtime, networks all but guaranteed he would be successful at the ballot box.There are plenty of data points to prove that the equation “candidate + getting a ton of coverage = successful campaign” doesn’t balance. Though it is very true, as Brown states, that Trump has received far more coverage than his competitors. Here’s the relevant section:But consider the tone of the coverage at Trump’s debut. When he first declared his candidacy, a majority of airtime was spent calling him a joke candidate who had no shot. Then the headlines proclaimed him a racist after his comments that Mexico was sending rapists to the U.S. Then the media said he was toast because he insulted John McCain for being a prisoner of war and again buried his campaign for his comments regarding Megyn Kelly’s debate moderation and Carly Fiorina’s face. “Media-driven surges are not sustainable,” wrote the New York Times, stating that Trump’s support was about to take a dive. That was in July.It’s also important to note that on an average weeknight, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC are getting approximately 3 million viewers combined. When did those ratings spike? During the debates, when viewership for the Republican contests would consistently rise above 10 million. During the most-watched events of the 2016 cycle, Trump was not getting solo time to give his stump speech without question. Instead, he was sharing the stage with his rivals and generally taking tough questions from moderators.Going into every debate, it was easy to guess what would happen after the closing statements. Pundits would say Trump was out of his depth and didn’t fare well; they would praise one of his rivals (generally Marco Rubio) and say that this debate would be the turning point that would end the billionaire’s run at the top of the polls. For example, here is NBC News’ Chuck Todd pointing to a September debate performance as the probable beginning of the end of Trump 2016. Following a debate in South Carolina, Sen. Lindsey Graham predicted Republicans there would reject Trump’s anti-George W. Bush, pro-Vladimir Putin rhetoric. Instead, Trump won every delegate in Graham’s home state. In the senator’s defense, a majority of Politico’s GOP insiders said the same thing. An Atlantic story in February called Trump’s debate night “terrible,” and a few days later he won a majority of Super Tuesday states. There are many, many examples of people in the media saying a Trump debate performance was going to cost him, followed by it having no adverse effect, to the point that eventually the headlines started to read along the lines of, “Trump didn’t do that great, but it’s probably not going to matter,” such as in this February analysis from our own Jon Ward.While pundits declared Trump dead after these performances, viewers (and voters) crowned the real estate magnate the winner of each debate in nearly every online poll. You could see it in our own very unofficial Yahoo surveys, on Drudge Report or all over social media: People liked what Trump was saying, even as moderators and analysts said how poorly he had done. Much like at the ballot box, people who voted in post-debate preference polls generally went with Trump.Where the media may be at fault for the Trump phenomenon is in ignoring the fact that the candidate is only popular among a plurality of Republican primary voters. Blasting speeches in which he denigrates minorities, women, immigrants and his fellow candidates over the airwaves has had the effect you might think it would on a majority of the country. Over 63 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Republican frontrunner, and in a March poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News, even a majority of voters who identified themselves as conservatives had a negative view of Trump. He is deeply unpopular among women and Hispanics, to name just two large constituencies that will be voting this November.But Trump isn’t popular among the people who vote for him simply because he’s on television more than his competitors. He’s popular with the people who vote for him because they like the platform on which he’s campaigning. A February poll of Republican voters in South Carolina found that 60 percent supported a ban on Muslims entering the United States, which seems like a lot until you see that 80 percent of those who planned to vote for Trump were in favor of the ban. These numbers were backed up by CBS News exit polling in the Palmetto State, which found that 75 percent of GOP voters wanted to bar Muslims from entering the country. A Pew Research Center study from March found that 69 percent of Trump supporters think immigrants are a burden on the country, while 67 percent think free trade is a bad thing.Voters back Trump not because they see him on TV a lot but because they feel like the Republican Party has betrayed them. In March, Yahoo News profiled a series of Trump supporters, and in hours of interviews, none of them said he had earned their vote by being on TV a lot.There are myriad reasons for Trump’s rise that will take years for people to unpack. Media — combined with his preexisting celebrity and name recognition — certainly played a role, but not quite as large of one as some in the industry are asserting. (One quote in Brown’s piece was, “At least this shows how much we still matter” — a very media thing to say considering that American trust in the industry is at a historical low.) It’s not Trump’s media exposure but his proposed plans for the country that make him extremely popular with a segment of American voters. And it’s those exact same positions — the ones he espouses on television, on Twitter and at his live events — that make him deeply, deeply unpopular with a significantly larger segment of the country."
N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory defends HB2: I can’t believe we’re talking about this,2279,"N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory makes remarks during an interview at the governor’s mansion in Raleigh, N.C., on April 12, 2016. (Photo: Gerry Broome/AP)North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory continues to defend the controversial “bathroom bill” he signed into law last month – rousing anger and boycotts by LGBT activists.In an appearance on “The Kelly File” Thursday night, the much-maligned governor argued that the primary purpose of House Bill 2 (HB2) is to protect the privacy of children in locker rooms, showers and bathrooms.“It’s the basic expectation of privacy that I hear from mom and dads and families that when their daughter or son goes into a facility, a restroom, they expect people of that gender … to be the only other ones in that. That’s the expectations that we’ve had for many, many years,” McCrory said to Fox News host Megyn Kelly.House Bill 2 essentially requires a person to use only the public restrooms that correspond with his or her biological sex — as indicated on their birth certificate — and prohibits local governments from passing their own antidiscrimination ordinances.North Carolina is already feeling the economic consequences of having a law on the books that many consider discriminatory. PayPal called off an expansion plan in Charlotte. Bruce Springsteen and other musicians have canceled concerts. Some politicians have also forbidden work travel for government employees in the Tar Heel State.McCrory said he has no interest in being the “bathroom police.” He emphasized that the law was a response to what he considers government overreach by Charlotte when it passed an ordinance that would have allowed transgender people to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identities.  “I don’t even know why we’re talking about this. This is not an issue that I started. This is an issue the left started, not the right,” McCrory replied. “And it’s not just women’s bathrooms; it’s boys’ bathrooms.”Kelly pushed back by saying that there is a misconception that transgender people are more likely to molest, and the bill reinforces that misconception. McCrory said he did not like those fear-based arguments either."
"Anti-Trump protests in Costa Mesa, Calif.",144,"Some 20 demonstrators were arrested on Thursday outside a Donald Trump campaign rally in southern California, where the Republican presidential frontrunner vowed to his supporters that he would get tough on illegal immigration if elected.Demonstrators smashed the window of a police squad car, marched in protest and blocked traffic as police in riot gear tried to disperse the crowd outside of the county fair grounds in Costa Mesa, Calif., according to local media and the Twitter account of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.The department said on its Twitter account that about 20 arrests were made and that no major injuries were reported.Trump visited Costa Mesa, a city of more than 100,000 people, a third of whom are Hispanic or Latino, hoping to garner support in California, where voters will go to the polls during the state’s Republican primary on June 7.

The GOP has split into Trump and Ryan wings,1431,"Photos: Mel Evans/AP, Carolyn Kaster/APThe day after Donald Trump swept five primaries this week and tightened his grip on the Republican nomination for president, both he and the other most prominent Republican politician in the country were speaking the language of populism.“We’re going to get rid of these politicians,” Trump said in his opening remarks during an hourlong appearance on Fox News on Wednesday in which Greta Van Susteren and a studio audience in Indianapolis lavished him with praise, sometimes in the form of questions.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., sounded a similar note. Ryan said at Georgetown University: “We do not believe we should be governed by our betters, that elites in Washington should make all those big decisions.”The similarities between Trump and Ryan, however, end with their recognition of antiestablishment sentiment. In fact, these two men have come to represent powerful and opposing wings of the Republican Party — perspectives that are on a collision course. The tension between the two men will become all the more evident if and when Trump clinches the nomination, and a clash would be all but unavoidable should Trump defy what appear to be high odds and defeat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for the presidency.And regardless of whether Trump wins or loses, the fight between his faction and Ryan’s will continue beyond this election.Trump has come to represent not just a pugnacious, take-no-prisoners style but a group of voters whose animating principle is that they want to blow up the existing order in Washington, D.C., and don’t care who they alienate along the way. Ryan, meanwhile, has emerged as the most formidable Republican leader arguing for rebuilding the party by rejecting the path of damn-the-consequences Trumpism.The contrasts between the two couldn’t be more stark. Trump lacks a coherent political ideology. Ryan has spent most of his adult life honing conservative philosophy and ideas. Trump rose to power through celebrity (and money). Ryan did it with ideas (and the power of an important House chairmanship). Trump’s candidacy is fueled by anger and disillusionment with government. Ryan is trying to repair public trust in Congress. Its approval rating has risen six points in Gallup’s regular tracking poll since Ryan became speaker at the end of October, but it is still a dismal 17 percent.Audience members take photos of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before a campaign rally at West Chester University in West Chester, Pa., on Monday. (Photo: Matt Slocum/AP)Many Trump supporters see in his business success and outsize personality the answer to a government they view as sprawling, stumbling and corrupt. To them, he is a strongman who can knock heads, hire “the best people” and make things work again by dislodging entrenched special interests and reducing the size of government. To that end, Trump has promised to take on lobbyists and political insiders, and often boasts that he is not taking money from wealthy donors. But close scrutiny of his proposals shows they would vastly increase the size of government and do almost nothing to reduce the national debt.Ryan also wants to restore confidence in government — but by reforming it and reducing its size and scope. In that effort, he has spent the last decade working inside the system and with Democrats. He spent the first half of the Obama administration pushing a plan to reform Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, with an eye to reducing long-term government debt. Since the 2012 election, when Ryan was the GOP vice presidential nominee, he has increasingly spoken about the needs of Americans stuck in cycles of poverty and crime.Trump, meanwhile, has promised not to change the entitlement programs that, along with demographic trends, are a driver of long-term debt. He even blamed Mitt Romney’s 2012 loss on his selection of Ryan as his running mate.The coming confrontation between Ryan and Trump — and the poles of the party they represent — has been building all year, with Ryan speaking out against Trump more often as the year has gone on. This month, he said Trump had “disfigured” American values with his call to ban all Muslims from the U.S., and that foreign heads of state in the Middle East had thanked him for repudiating Trump when the businessman announced his proposal in December.When a young Republican student at Georgetown University told Ryan Wednesday that he was “dismayed” by the presidential election, Ryan smiled wryly and joked, “Why is that?” The audience laughed. And when the student asked Ryan reasons he could give to be optimistic, Ryan responded by talking about the policy agenda he is promoting in the House for Congress, and said: “Look at the policies, not the person necessarily.”Ryan spoke at Georgetown and answered questions from students as part of an ongoing effort on his part to broaden the appeal of the Republican Party. He opened his remarks by joking about the party’s lack of appeal to young people. “Why support Republicans?” he asked, and paused as the audience laughed in response, and applauded. “I’m going to go out on a limb and I’m going to assume that the thought has not been occurring to most of you recently.”House Speaker Paul D. Ryan during a town hall on Wednesday at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Yuri Gripas/Reuters) Ryan’s remark was an offhand way of acknowledging that Trump’s candidacy has not been winning over very many converts among young voters. But he sought to persuade the students that the GOP actually stands for a vision of the future that is radically at odds with the message that has come from Trump. “The America that you want is the America that we want: open, diverse, dynamic,” Ryan said.But Ryan has also resisted calls for him to openly disavow Trump, and has maintained he will support whoever emerges as the Republican nominee. He has been mocked for doing so, but if Trump were to win the presidency, Ryan would loom as the largest counterbalance to Trump’s nativist and authoritarian approach. Most recently, Trump has said he would change the rules of the Republican primary nominating system. It’s something far easier said than done, but indicates the degree to which Trump has no use for the checks and balances inherent in American democracy since the nation’s founding.Ryan has made clear that one of his top five priorities in Congress next year is to dramatically reduce the power of the president. He reiterated this at Georgetown on Wednesday.“We need to restore the Constitution and Article 1 in the Constitution. What that means is the laws we live under should be written by we, through our elected representatives. Right now we don’t really have that,” Ryan said. “We’ve got this fourth branch of government — unelected bureaucrats — writing our rules, writing our regulations that govern our society, that determine how our businesses run, how our schools work. It determines almost everything we do.”Ryan blamed both President Obama and previous Republican presidents for expanding executive power. And he added: “We believe in self-determination. We believe in government by consent of the governed. We are losing that. So we have a lot of ideas for restoring that.”Earlier in the day, Ryan said he’d spoken with Trump about his agenda for next year, and said all had been supportive.“I said here is what we’re doing, here’s where we’re going. Here’s why we’re doing it. We decided this last year before the presidential election got even started. And yes, we had a very pleasant conversation,” Ryan said on CNN.Of course, around the same time that Ryan and Trump had that conversation, Trump also publicly threatened Ryan during a press conference. “Paul Ryan, I don’t know him well, but I’m sure I’m going to get along great with him, and if I don’t? He’s gonna have to pay a big price, OK?” Trump said.Ryan this week indicated there is a high degree of uncertainty about how Trump would conduct himself as president. Asked by CBS’ Charlie Rose how Trump’s brand of Republicanism would differ from his own, Ryan responded: “We’ll find out.”Ryan’s aggressive and omnipresent media efforts — TV and print interviews, a social media presence and constant video content out of his office — are seen by the press as signs of pure political ambition. But it’s more than that. Ryan is also an institutionalist, who believes Congress has to be trusted to work.Ryan’s media operation is part of an attempt to restore faith in government. By communicating clearly and often Congress’ goals and how they will be accomplished, Ryan is seeking to reverse a growing pattern in which lawmakers have overpromised to get elected and then underdelivered on their pledges, from ending the war in Iraq to repealing Obamacare.Ryan’s most immediate political concern is to maintain a Republican majority in the House. It’s a growing concern that with Trump at the top of the ticket, the GOP could lose its 30-seat advantage, which had been thought impregnable. The GOP’s four-seat edge in the Senate is slim in comparison.Ryan wants to give Republican candidates in competitive states or congressional districts a positive, forward-looking message to run on, rather than the grievance-based politics of Trump.“Instead of playing the identity politics of ‘our base’ and ‘their base,’” Ryan said recently, he thinks the GOP should seek to “unite people around ideas and principles.”Republicans, Ryan said, should not “just oppose someone or something” but should instead “propose a clear and compelling alternative.”“And when we do that, we don’t just win the argument. We don’t just win your support. We win your enthusiasm,” he said.If Ryan’s vision of what the GOP should be is to win out over Trump’s, it will have to do just that."

Boehner calls Cruz ‘Lucifer in the flesh’,14667,"John Boehner likened Ted Cruz to the devil on Wednesday. (Photo: Yuri Gripas/Reuters/File)Former House Speaker John Boehner offered a rather blunt assessment of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday night.“Lucifer in the flesh,” Boehner said during a talk hosted by Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., according to the Stanford Daily. “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.”The Ohio Republican, who retired from Congress last fall, said he would vote for whomever the party nominates for president — unless it’s Cruz.Boehner described the other two GOP hopefuls, Donald Trump and John Kasich, as his “friends.”Boehner said he has played golf with Trump for years and that they were “texting buddies.” His relationship with the Ohio governor, however, “requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends … but he’s still my friend, and I love him.”Cruz, who introduced Carly Fiorina as his running mate on Wednesday, responded to Boehner’s barb on Twitter Thursday morning.“Tell me again who will stand up to Washington?” the Texas senator tweeted. “Trump, who’s Boehner’s ‘texting and golfing buddy,’ or Carly & me?”“He allowed his inner Trump to come out,” Cruz said later at a press conference in Indiana. “I think John Boehner has made it crystal clear … if you want a president like John Boehner, Donald trump is your man.”On the Democratic side, Boehner called Bernie Sanders “a nice guy” and “the most honest politician” in the race despite disagreeing with the Vermont senator on virtually every issue.But Boehner drew boos from the audience for suggesting Hillary Clinton is pandering to female voters.“‘Oh, I’m a woman, vote for me,’” he reportedly said.And while Boehner believes Clinton will ultimately win the Democratic nomination, there could be more twists in store.“Don’t be shocked … if two weeks before the convention, here comes Joe Biden parachuting in and Barack Obama fanning the flames to make it all happen,” he said.While waiting at San Francisco International Airport for his flight back to Washington, D.C., Boehner didn’t back away from the comments and seemed surprised that they caused such a stir.“It’s not like I haven’t said the same thing in a bunch of speeches this year,” the former House speaker told Yahoo News.During an appearance at a financial conference in Florida last month, Boehner, who had previously labeled Cruz a “jackass,” referred to the Texas senator as “Lucifer.”At the same event, Boehner endorsed his successor, House Speaker Paul Ryan, for president.“If we don’t have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I’m for none of the above,” Boehner said, according to Politico. “They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I’m for none of the above. I’m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.”But Boehner told Yahoo News he thinks Trump will win the nomination, barring a major self-inflicted error."
Trump’s ‘America First’ neo-isolationism,866,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., April 27, 2016. (Photo: Jim Bourg/Reuters)After rolling over its opponents in all five Eastern seaboard primaries, the Trump juggernaut entered Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, where the victorious candidate gave a speech intended to add gravitas to his scattershot positions on foreign policy and national security. As he edges closer to becoming the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump field-tested a new bumper sticker to describe his unique brand of economic populism and trade protectionism, anti-immigrant nativism and a neo-isolationism that eschews foreign entanglements: “America First!”“The direction I’m outlining will return us to a timeless principle — always putting the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first,” Trump said. “That will be the foundation of every single decision that I make. ‘America First’ will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.”Putting America first hardly seems a controversial idea for a U.S. president, but the phrase has a long lineage in Republican politics dating back to the isolationist, noninterventionist wing of the party in the 1930s and 1940s. The America First Committee of the 1930s was established to keep the United States out of the approaching Second World War, and its noninterventionist agenda was embraced by Republican Sen. Robert Taft, who ran for his party’s presidential nomination in 1948 and 1952. Many Republican foreign policy experts in particular worry that, coupled with Trump’s strongman persona and what many see as his strong-arm instincts, the America First agenda would amount to a rejection of the United States’ outsize role in protecting the liberal international order put in place after World War II.Under his America First conceit, Trump recited a familiar litany of foreign policy positions and criticisms of the Obama administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He once again suggested a moratorium on Muslim immigration and opposed the Obama administration’s “senseless” immigration policies that “import extremism.” He threatened to punish U.S. companies that move jobs overseas and to quickly reverse the country’s lopsided trade imbalance with China by using economic coercion. He promised to rebuild depleted U.S. military power but also to use it sparingly, eschewing nation-building or democracy promotion overseas. In the early days of his administration, a President Trump would hold summits with European and Asian allies and demand that they pay America more for its security umbrella, or else he would be willing to close it and walk away from those alliances.Going further than just bashing the free-trade agenda, Trump denigrated multilateral agreements and international institutions that undergird a rules-based international order and the dynamic of globalization that has been a driving force in spreading liberal economic and political values for decades.“No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Our friends and enemies put their interests above ours, and we must start doing the same,” Trump said. Insisting that nation-states remain the foundation of “happiness and harmony,” he voiced skepticism of “international unions that tie us up, and bring America down. Under my administration we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. … No longer will I surrender our people to the false song of globalization.”Arguably not since Patrick Buchanan in 1996, and possibly not since Taft in 1952, has a serious Republican presidential hopeful embraced such an isolationist platform or called into question an international order based on free markets and international institutions, and both of those previous Republican candidates ultimately lost the nomination.In Trump’s telling, his agenda is not isolationist, but rather a sign of strong leadership. Allies and adversaries alike will respect America’s newfound strength and determination, in his view, and respond to border walls, trade tariffs and demands for more burden-sharing by quickly getting into line. What worries many Republican foreign policy experts is that that expectation doesn’t comport with reality as they understand it.“Donald Trump is no Taft-style isolationist, because while Taft was clearly wrong, he was a decent and thoughtful man that you could never accuse of disrespect for the Constitution,” said Eliot Cohen, director of the strategic studies program at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and a former counselor in George W. Bush’s State Department. Contrast that stance, he said, with Trump’s dubiously constitutional intentions to ban Muslims from entering the country, to torture suspected terrorists and kill their families.“His promises to make allies pay more for our support also shows that he thinks of American foreign policy the way a mobster thinks about protection rackets,” said Cohen. “He has similarly shown an affection for strongmen like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, and has surrounded himself with people who are cozy with Putin’s crowd, which is quite sinister. You’d have to be delusional to believe that all that demagoguery is fake, and now Trump is somehow going to pivot and become ‘very presidential.’”In early March, Cohen helped organize a letter signed by roughly 50 Republican foreign policy experts united in their opposition to a Trump nomination, calling his vision of American power “wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle” and predicting that as president he would act in ways that make the country less safe. The letter has garnered more than 120 signatures and counting.“Since 1948, there has been a foreign policy tradition in the Republican Party of free and open trade, a reliance on alliances and a conservative internationalism to uphold the global order that the United States created after World War II, and Trump has taken positions in opposition to all of those things,” said Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey who served as a senior official in the Defense and State Departments during the George W. Bush administration. Edelman is one of the signers of the letter opposing Trump’s nomination. “Trump is clearly not conservative, and he is barely a Republican, and to convince many of us that he is really serious about foreign policy would require that he repudiate almost every position he has taken. Add in his lack of mastery of policy issues and his willingness to use mob psychology to whip up crowds in ugly ways, and I conclude he would be a threat to the constitutional order.”As the ultimate outsider candidate, of course, Trump has worn the nearly unprecedented repudiation of the Republican foreign policy establishment as a badge of honor. When Trump earlier announced his kitchen cabinet of foreign policy advisers, it amounted to five names that most Washington observers had never heard of, including a former Pentagon inspector general and a 2009 graduate of DePaul University who specialized in energy issues involving Cyprus, Greece and Israel.In his speech Wednesday, Trump argued that Washington could use some new blood and officials not associated with past failures. “My goal is a foreign policy that will endure for several generations,” he said. “That’s why I have to look for talented experts with new approaches, rather than surround myself with people with perfect résumés who have little to brag about except failed policies and continued losses in war. We have to look to new people, because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they are doing, even though they look good writing in the New York Times or appearing on television.”One of those “old” Republican foreign policy experts is Kurt Volker, executive director of the McCain Institute and former U.S. ambassador to NATO. Unlike many of his former colleagues in the Bush administration, Volker did not sign the letter opposing Trump’s nomination, precisely because it seemed likely to reinforce the argument that the Republican establishment is united against his candidacy. Also, if Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States, Volker figures the commander in chief will need all the good advice he can get, from wherever he can get it.“Trump has tapped into a huge frustration in the country from a public that believes the political and foreign policy elite in Washington have really messed things up, and there’s some truth to that. So he’s their change agent to turn the situation upside down and start over,” Volker said in an interview. “Trump is also clearly a very forceful personality, and he could conceivably channel that into strong American leadership. The problem is whenever Trump opens his mouth and praises Putin, or denigrates Muslims, or threatens to pull out of our alliances, our friends around the world don’t see a strong American leader. They see someone to fear.”James Kitfield is a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress."
A failed pact tells you why Trump is winning,1861,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Julie Jacobson/AP, AP (2)Like Stalin and Churchill huddled over a map of Europe in 1944, Ted Cruz and John Kasich began a very odd week by announcing — publicly, for reasons known only to them — that they were divvying up the remaining primary states in order to maintain individual spheres of influence. Cruz would get Indiana (which is next to Ohio), while Kasich would get New Mexico (which shares a border with Texas). Super-logical.Of course, primary voters — unlike, say, Polish peasants — tend to do whatever they want, so all this plotting didn’t exactly make Cruz and Kasich grandmasters of global domination. More like a couple of guys playing Risk in somebody’s basement. Ural attacks Irkutsk! Coming for you next, Kamchatka!And like most games of Risk, the whole thing  fell apart  within a few hours, as both campaigns backtracked and said they weren’t telling voters in any state not to vote for their chosen candidates, exactly. They just weren’t telling voters they should vote for their chosen candidates, either.“I’m not telling anybody anything in Indiana, because I’m not competing there,” Kasich told the baffled hosts of NBC’s “Today” show. He accused the media of obsessing over process, which seemed odd, since it was his and Cruz’s campaigns that had apparently spent days, if not weeks, dividing up media markets according to the latest polls.When Matt Lauer finally asked him point blank whom Republican voters in Indiana should vote for, Kasich replied: “I’m not getting into that, Matt. Things are not so plain and simple.”No offense to Lauer or Savannah Guthrie here, but when you manage to make a morning show interview look like a scene from “Frost/Nixon,” it’s probably an indication that you should step back and think through what you’re doing.In the end, the short-lived pact between Cruz and Kasich — followed closely by Cruz’s equally odd announcement that he was taking on a running mate, but more about that in a minute — served only to make a couple of things even clearer than they were before.The first is that you should never, ever take strategic advice from Mitt Romney, unless it has to do with buying up companies and shedding overhead.And the second is that there is a substantive vacuum at the heart of this year’s non-Trump campaigns — a vacuum that has, as much as anything else, enabled Trump to emerge, especially after Tuesday’s romp through the Eastern Seaboard, as a near-certain nominee.It’s not just that the Cruz and Kasich campaigns managed, in the space of a few hours, to validate all of Trump’s conspiracy theories about the dark soul of the Republican establishment — although they did that pretty well.For weeks, after all, Trump has been going around saying that corrupt Republicans are rigging the system against him, even though, as I’ve written before, the nominating rules of the party have always been the same.But whatever high ground Trump’s opponents may have commanded was pretty much squandered when Cruz and Kasich announced that they were, in fact, going to game the system in an effort to subvert Trump at the convention. Now, when Trump says the party elites are trying to rig the process and undermine the voters, you’d have to admit he’s not crazy.What’s more illuminating about the nonaggression pact, though, is that it even seemed plausible to both sides in the first place. In a world where Cruz and Kasich, Trump’s only remaining obstacles, were offering any galvanizing arguments of their own, there couldn’t possibly be any discussion of one side ceding voters to the other.They represent, after all, two sharply opposed views of the party’s future. Cruz is a divider and a moral crusader, a peddler of nostalgia, a party crasher who essentially disdains government and those who serve in it.Kasich is a bridge builder and a futurist, a successful insider who embraces the power of governance. Where Cruz sees a Republican Party that has destroyed itself by cravenly compromising its principles, Kasich sees a party that has grown too inflexible, too narrow and too often mean.But neither camp has advanced much by way of a substantive vision. Cruz’s campaign is a bland rhetorical exercise, lacking any signature proposals. Kasich goes on about the Ohio record, but I defy anyone to synthesize his plan for replicating that success as president.So why should a bunch of principles get in the way of tactics?Kasich can decry the media’s focus on process, but the suggestion that he and Cruz could somehow appeal to the same voters in Indiana or New Mexico is a tacit admission of how mushy their underlying rationales still are. It’s an admission that they haven’t asked Republican voters to choose any real direction for the party other than to stop Trump from becoming the nominee.How else are we supposed to view the sudden political marriage of Cruz and Carly Fiorina? Other than to create the least likable ticket in human history, it only served to reinforce how cynically tactical Cruz’s entire campaign really is.No one can believe Cruz went through the rigorous process of choosing the best-qualified potential vice president in America before rushing out to introduce his new partner. What he did was to look at the demographics and decide that Trump had a particular vulnerability with women, and it had to be exploited now.Trump’s campaign apparatus, from all outward appearances, is about as orderly as a Pakistani traffic circle. The campaign manager who shoved a reporter got shoved aside, although now he may be back.The new boss — who, according to my colleague Michael Isikoff, has some lingering business issues with Russian oligarchs in the Cayman Islands, no joke — is said to be on the outs already, after telling a roomful of Republicans that Trump was just an actor playing a role. Apparently this was meant to be reassuring.But hey, train wreck or not, here’s one thing no one can say about Trump — that he lacks an argument. Ask any third-grader in America — I’m serious about this — what Trump wants to do as president, and I’m guessing more than half of them will tell you he’s going to build a wall and make the Mexicans pay for it, or that he’s going to make America great again, or that he’s going to stop Chy-nah from stealing our money.This cultural saturation isn’t merely a measure of Trump’s skill as an entertainer. It’s also a reflection of how consistently he’s held to his theme, how utterly fearless he’s been in the face of endless derision and common sense.Trump may be running the most disingenuous and synthetic campaign in memory, but he knows exactly what it’s about, and so does everyone else.And because of this he’s done to this year’s Republican race — and to the Cruz and Kasich campaigns — exactly what he’s done to every building or airplane he’s ever acquired, to every televised stage he’s ever graced.He’s made them all about Trump and nothing else."
Ted Cruz picks Carly Fiorina as running mate in a highly unusual move,6508,"During a rally Wednesday afternoon in Indianapolis, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he had selected former Hewlett-Packard CEO and unsuccessful 2016 GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his running mate.“After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be the president of the United States, I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee Carly Fiorina,” Cruz told hundreds of flag-waving supporters gathered at the Pavilion at Pan Am Plaza.As cheers of “Carly! Carly!” subsided, Cruz hailed Fiorina as “an extraordinary leader,” reciting her résumé and lauding her experience as the “first female CEO in history of a Fortune 20 company.”“Over and over again, Carly has shattered glass ceilings,” Cruz said.It was yet another whiplash-inducing twist in what has become the weirdest presidential campaign in recent memory.Ted Cruz and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina wave during a rally in Indianapolis, April 27, 2016, when Cruz announced he has tapped Fiorina to serve as his running mate. (Photo: Michael Conroy/AP)In a normal election year, an announcement like Cruz’s wouldn’t be so strange. Picking a vice-presidential partner is a regular and ritualistic part of the nomination process. Staffers start with a long list of contenders. They whittle it down to a shortlist, which inevitably leaks. The campaigns vet the candidates; so does the press. Eventually, the nominee settles on a sidekick who satisfies his chosen criteria: electoral strength, ideological balance, personal compatibility, readiness to serve as president and so forth. The pick is announced, the media salivates, the “rollout” commences.All of which is happening right now.The only difference? Unlike pretty much every other person in U.S. history who has selected a running mate, Cruz is not yet his party’s presidential nominee — and the odds are, he never will be.“This selection seems to violate the norms followed by presidential candidates of both parties, which have usually produced able running mates and have helped elevate the office,” says Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who specializes in vice presidential history.It’s no mystery why Cruz felt compelled to jump the gun here. As conservative blogger Allahpundit explained earlier today, “He knew a blowout was coming on Tuesday and he’d need to shift the conversation afterward immediately with Indiana set to vote in just a week. Picking a VP is the only card he has to play that can suck some media away from Trump, at least for a few hours. … Without a ‘major’ development to discuss, he’[d] be left answering ‘How can you possibly win?’ questions for the rest of the week.”It’s also no mystery why Cruz felt that Fiorina was his best veep option (even though, unlike Kasich or Marco Rubio, she doesn’t come with any delegates). After dropping out of the race in February, she became one of Cruz’s earliest and most vocal supporters. She has proven herself an able and agile attack dog — particularly when her quarry is Donald Trump or  Hillary Clinton  (a.k.a. the two people standing between Cruz and the presidency). As a businesswoman who has never held elected office, she is a political outsider at a time when GOP voters seem to crave political outsiders. She is a woman — a point Cruz made repeatedly — which could further weaken Trump with women voters and somewhat counterbalance Clinton’s strength in that department further down the road (in theory). And she is a popular figure among Republicans in California, where she lived for decades and won the party’s 2010 Senate nomination. Incidentally, California is  going to a host a fairly important GOP primary in few weeks  .Still, pre-announcing Fiorina as his running mate is a perilous move for Cruz. It may strike voters not yet sold on Cruz as presumptuous — the equivalent of Al Gore launching his transition effort before the courts had officially decided the 2000 election. It would certainly limit Cruz’s leverage at a contested convention, where the veep slot can be a powerful bargaining chip — perhaps the only one with the power to propel a second-place candidate past the 1,237-delegate mark in later rounds of balloting. And even as a messaging maneuver, it may backfire. Ronald Reagan and his then running mate, Richard Schweiker, at a 1976 news conference in Philadelphia, where they charged that President Ford was playing “the same old politics” with his vice presidential choice, and warned that it would take the party to defeat in November. (Photo: Corbis)“It seems like a last-ditch, desperate move,” Goldstein tells Yahoo News. “The vice-presidential selection sends messages about the selector. To choose someone who is not really an A-lister after an apparently truncated search does not send reassuring messages about Senator Cruz’s appreciation of the role of the office or his decision-making approach.”If the press treats Cruz’s premature decision as a sign of desperation, it could spell trouble. As Goldstein notes, “not since 1936 has a running mate had zero years prior experience as a senator, high executive official, governor or member of the House of Representatives. That lack is particularly glaring in that Senator Cruz himself lacks as much experience in those positions as most presidential nominees.” Fiorina has other vulnerabilities as well, including her role in HP’s troubled merger with Compaq, which  led to some 30,000 layoffs, and the fact that she lost both of her campaigns by massive margins. Trump  will surely harp on both.Only once in U.S. history has a candidate dared to select a running mate before clinching the nomination. The year was 1976. The candidate was Ronald Reagan. The former California governor was neck-and-neck with incumbent President Gerald Ford at the time, and his hope was that Richard Schweiker, a moderate U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, would soothe fears about his Western conservatism and flip some middle-of-the-road delegates in the weeks before the convention.Instead, Reagan’s choice enraged many conservative delegates who were still angry about Ford’s veep selection two years earlier: moderate Nelson Rockefeller.Reagan lost the nomination. But just barely. Announcing his VP pick much earlier than Reagan — long before the end of the primaries and months before the convention — is a sign that Cruz is unlikely to come as close to winning the nod as his hero did four decades ago. It may even push the prize further out of reach.   "
Trump’s foreign policy: ‘new visions’ and ‘more unpredictable’ attacks on ISIS,337,"Donald Trump takes the stage to deliver a foreign policy speech on Aprii 27 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)WASHINGTON — Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said the United States must be more “unpredictable” if it is to defeat Islamic terrorism, and, if elected, vowed to bring in “new voices and new visions” to overhaul what he described as President Obama’s “reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy.”In the first of a projected series of policy speeches, Trump trashed Obama for weakening the country by failing to present a “coherent” foreign policy and for allowing rivals such as China to “take advantage” of the United States. The GOP frontrunner said if he wins the presidency he would put “American security above all else,” and said his driving ideology for every policy decision will be “America first.”“It is time to shake the rust off of America’s foreign policy,” Trump declared.But the New York real estate mogul offered few specifics on how exactly he would do that. In a roughly 40-minute speech to a forum sponsored by the Center for the National Interest, a think tank founded by former President Richard Nixon, Trump offered mainly broad strokes about his foreign policy vision, reiterating themes he’s been discussing on the campaign trail for months — including his call for the United States to be less forthcoming about how it plans to target enemies like ISIS.“We must, as a nation, be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable,“ Trump said. “We have to be unpredictable, starting now.”As for ISIS, Trump vowed they will be gone “very, very quickly” if he wins the presidency.“Their days are numbered. I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how,” he said, repeating a line he’s regularly used on the campaign trail. “But they are going to be gone, and soon.”The speech Wednesday marked a departure for Trump, who, for only the second time as a presidential candidate, read his remarks from a Teleprompter. The effect was a more somber Trump compared to the boisterous, off-the-cuff candidate voters have seen on the stage in recent months. Trump’s appearance marked the first significant attempt by the candidate to show a more presidential side, in terms of policy, as he looks toward a general-election matchup with Hillary Clinton.In the speech, he repeatedly tied Clinton to what he described as Obama’s “weak” foreign policy — suggesting that by electing her the country would simply continue down the same “failed” path. But without naming names, Trump also took aim at Republicans like former President George W. Bush, criticizing the Iraq War and insisting a Trump administration would be “getting out of the nation-building business,” which he said has resulted in little but “chaos.”“It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western democracy,” Trump said. “In the Middle East, our goals must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear-sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.”Several times, Trump took direct aim at the foreign-policy establishment — insisting he would turn to “talented experts with new approaches” instead of relying on “those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.”Trump’s speech seemed to be directed not at Washington but at Republicans across the country who have voiced concerns about whether the brash real estate mogul has the temperament to serve as the commander in chief. Several times, Trump cast himself as someone who would be strong but also judicious about using force.“Unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs of strength,” Trump said, adding that he was looking to build a foreign policy that would “endure for several generations.”"
"Ex-House Speaker Hastert gets 15 months, admits sex abuse",312,"By Fiona Ortiz and Justin MaddenCHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, once one of the country’s most powerful politicians, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 months in federal prison for a financial crime related to sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago.U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Durkin called Hastert a serial sex abuser in handing down the sentence, which was longer than the zero to six months recommended by federal prosecutors. Durkin said the sentence would have been even longer if it weren’t for Hastert’s age, 74, and poor health.Frail and clinging to a walker, Hastert apologized for sexually abusing boys when he was a teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville.“I’m sorry to those I hurt and misled. I wanted to apologize for the boys I mistreated,” Hastert told Durkin at the two-hour sentencing hearing in federal court in Chicago.The judge asked him if he acknowledged sexual abuse of his victims and Hastert said he did.Hastert, the longest-serving Republican House speaker in history and a successful international lobbyist who was earning $75,000 a month, pleaded guilty last October to the crime of structuring. That involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection.He needed the cash after he reached a secret agreement with one of his five sexual abuse victims to pay him $3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering.The judge said that even though Hastert could not be charged with sex abuse because the statute of limitations had run out, he could take the conduct into consideration at sentencing.“Some conduct is unforgivable no matter how old it is. The abuse was 40 years ago but the damage lasts today,” Durkin said.Hastert’s defense had asked for a probation-only sentence, arguing that his shame and humiliation were punishment enough. His portrait has been removed from the Capitol, the seat of the U.S. Congress, and his alma mater Wheaton College stripped his name from a public policy center.“Nothing is more stunning than having the words ‘serial child molester’ and 'speaker of the house’ in the same sentence,” Durkin acknowledged. But he said that an extremely aggravating factor in the sentencing was that Hastert lied to federal agents about the money and falsely claimed that the victim was extorting him. He said Hastert must serve two years of probation and go through sex-offender treatment after release, and also pay a $250,000 fine.Scott Cross, 53, one of Hastert’s victims, and Jolene Burdge, the sister of another victim who is deceased, both spoke during the hearing.“Don’t be a coward, Mr. Hastert,” Burdge said. “Tell the truth. What you did wasn’t misconduct. It was sexual abuse of a minor.”Cross, the first victim to ever speak publicly about the abuse, choked up as he described how Hastert molested him in the wrestling locker room in 1972.“As a 17-year-old boy I was devastated,” he told the judge. “I tried to figure out why Coach Hastert had singled me out. I felt very alone and tremendously embarrassed.”Hastert, a conservative who trumpeted his honesty and small-town values when he was in Washington, D.C., said he did not contest Cross’s statement.But his defense said the former politician had forgotten the incident from 1972 and had even approached Cross’s older brother, Tom Cross, former Illinois House Republican leader, and asked him to write a letter of support to the judge.The sex abuse victim who received money from Hastert has not been named publicly. On Monday, using the name James Doe, he sued Hastert for $1.8 million, saying he had received only $1.7 million of the promised compensation.Hastert had been out on bail pending sentencing. When there is room for him, he will report to a federal prison where he can get medical treatment after suffering a life-threatening blood infection last year.(Editing by James Dalgleish)"
"Unconventional #7: Why Indiana is do-or-die for Cruz, the generals who would be president (and more!)",278,"Ted Cruz, Donald Trump. (Photo Illustration: Yahoo News, AP, Lake County Museum/Getty Images) Unconventional is Yahoo News’ complete guide to what could be the craziest presidential convention — or conventions — in decades. Here’s what you need to know today  . So Super “Acela” Tuesday wasn’t exactly a nail-biter. Donald Trump was expected to win big in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Connecticut, and (surprise) that’s exactly what he did.Don’t worry, though: Next Tuesday should more than make up for it.How do we know? Because on May 3, Indiana Republicans will finally go to the polls. Fifty-seven delegates will be up for grabs — the most of any remaining state that isn’t named California. No other state will be voting that day. And Indiana isn’t just another stop on the way to Cleveland. With John Kasich agreeing to step aside — a scheme designed to give Ted Cruz a direct shot at capturing enough Indiana delegates to alter Trump’s trajectory and block him from hitting the magic 1,237 mark before the convention — the Hoosier State seems to have become  the GOP battleground that, more than any other, could force a contested convention.Raising the stakes even higher is the fact that — unlike the last six states to vote — Indiana is an honest-to-goodness tossup. Polling is scarce, in part because it’s rarely been necessary in the past and in part because it’s unusually expensive. (Indiana law prohibits automated polling, the go-to method for many low-cost pollsters, and the state doesn’t register voters by party, which makes it harder to find a representative sample of respondents.) Some of the fundamentals favor Cruz. Others favor Trump. One could make strong case for the senator from Texas. One could also make a strong case for the tinsel-haired mogul from Manhattan. But to predict a winner would, at this point, be a very risky move. It’s that close.Here are the arguments in favor of a Cruz victory. And a Trump victory.Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz speaks to supporters at the Boone County 4-H Fairgrounds in Lebanon, Ind., on April 23, 2016. (Photo: J. Kyle Keener/Pharos-Tribune via AP)The case for Cruz:  Basically, Cruz’s people think that Indiana is a lot like Wisconsin — a state where Cruz clobbered Trump by 13 percentage points. Their plan is to take the formula that worked on the Cheeseheads and reapply it to the Hoosiers.This plan makes some sense. Like Wisconsin, Indiana is a largely white Midwestern state with lots of rural areas (where Cruz always does well) and well-educated, white-collar suburbs that more closely resemble the Milwaukee metropolitan area (where Cruz cleaned up) than, say, Detroit or Chicago (which favored Trump).Actually, in some ways, Indiana is even friendlier terrain for Cruz than Wisconsin. As RealClearPolitics’ Sean Trende has explained, the Hoosier State is something of a regional outlier: During the New Deal, cities with large white ethnic populations like Erie, Cleveland, Toledo and Chicago took on a distinct class cleavage that layered a new type of politics over these states’ historic Civil War-era cleavages. In the postwar era, the influx of African-Americans to these cities added a racial dimension to their politics.  Indiana was different. It had only a slim slice of lakefront, and never developed a major industrial metropolis outside of the Hammond/Gary areas on that lakefront. It didn’t attract large numbers of European immigrants, and so it never developed a deep New Deal politics; it was one of a handful of states to vote against Franklin Roosevelt twice. It also, outside of the Gary/Hammond area, never developed a heavily racialized post-New Deal politics, at least to the extent that we saw in other major cities during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s. As a result, Indiana is more conservative, overall, than most of its Midwestern neighbors. It’s also more evangelical (as opposed to Catholic). That’s all good news for Cruz.To capitalize, the Texan is again relying on his unrivaled field operation. He has repeatedly deployed his father, Rafael Cruz, to mobilize evangelicals. He has imported the “Camp Cruz” volunteers, who helped propel him to victory in Wisconsin. He has opened four offices around the state and hired a sizable paid staff.Meanwhile, Team Cruz (and outside anti-Trump groups) is already spending heavily on ads: $4.2 million combined, compared with $963,000 for Trump. The candidate himself has  been camped out in Indiana for much of the last week  , while Trump has visited only once.If the pact with Kasich works — and there are some serious impediments, including mixed messages from Kasich himself and the fact that  66,000 Hoosiers voted before the alliance was even announced  — then Cruz could pick up enough votes, theoretically, to put him over the top.Donald Trump speaks to guests and supporters during a rally at the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Ind.,on April 20, 2016. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)The case for Trump:  After Trump’s enormous wins Tuesday — and Cruz’s four last-place finishes — momentum will be a factor. Because the Donald’s margins were larger than the polls predicted, and because he won nearly every pledged delegate, the press will spend the next six days reinforcing his primary-night message — “I consider myself the presumptive nominee” — and questioning whether Cruz, who was mathematically eliminated from hitting 1,237 Tuesday night, is even a viable alternative. Indiana Republicans might start to agree.But Trump has other advantages in Indiana as well; the demographics, for instance, don’t just favor Cruz. Compared to Wisconsinites, Indianans are poorer, less educated and less inclined to marry — all factors that have helped Trump in past contests.Earlier, we noted that Indiana polls were scarce. But there have been a few in recent days — and the few there all give Trump a modest edge. According to RealClearPolitics, Trump’s average support stands at 39.3 percent; Cruz’s hovers around 33 percent. The Kasich pact could change the math — his polling average was 19.3 percent prior to Sunday’s big announcement — but still, Trump is ahead. If he were to beat Cruz by six points next Tuesday, he would win the vast majority of Indiana’s 57 delegates.Also, while Cruz may have the superior ground game, Trump is hardly ceding the state. He will be holding a large rally Wednesday at the Indiana Farmers Coliseum and campaigning constantly through next Tuesday. He too has opened several offices and hired paid staff. And when it comes to basketball — Indiana’s secular religion — Trump has a serious leg up on Cruz, having received the endorsement of legendary Indiana University coach Bobby Knight, who will be rallying alongside him in the coming days. Cruz, meanwhile, just botched his re-enactment of the classic pep-talk scene from “Hoosiers” by calling the hoop a “basketball ring.”Finally, the cease-fire with Kasich may hurt Cruz as much as it helps him. For weeks, Trump has been arguing that the GOP “establishment” has “rigged” the system to keep him from winning.Trump was wrong before: Nothing was rigged; he was just railing against the rules. But now his rivals are actually conspiring against him. That could turn some voters off.“I’m pissed,” Tim Poe, a mechanic from Connersville, Ind., told the Indianapolis Star earlier this week. “I do think that even people who don’t like Trump are going to see how crooked this s*** is. I think it’s going to backfire. There are some guys down on the [gun] range that feel the same way.”_____After losing four of five eastern states to Hillary Clinton Tuesday, Bernie Sanders’ already slim path to winning enough delegates to clinch the nomination all but closed.Some members of Sanders’ inner circle seemed to recognize this reality. “If we are sitting here and there’s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be upfront about that,” senior strategist Tad Devine told the New York Times. Sanders’ own statement on the Tuesday primaries, emailed to reporters late that night, seemed to suggest that Sanders was already shifting his focus away from the presidency and toward policy instead.“The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be,” Sanders said [emphasis added]. “That’s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast. That is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform.”But at least one Sanders loyalist didn’t seem to get the memo. Last night, Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, joined Yahoo News for an interview — and kept insisting that Sanders would try to flip superdelegates at the convention in Philadelphia.“The truth is the superdelegates are going to pick who the nominee is,” Weaver said. “That’s clear — no one’s going to have 2,383 going into the convention with pledged delegates alone. So, the thing is set up — superdelegates are going to make this election. … If the public general election polls continue to show [that Sanders is] the strongest candidate against all the Republicans, then we are going to make the case to the superdelegates that he is the candidate that they should pick.”Check out the clip above for more — and stay tuned as the Sanders campaign reassesses (and, hopefully, clarifies) its strategy in the days ahead. What do you think? Should Sanders keep campaigning for the presidency? Or should he focus on influencing Clinton’s policy priorities and supporting like-minded down-ticket Democrats?

George Washington — America’s first commander in chief — none of these presidents ever held another elected office.In addition, several generals have won their party’s presidential nominations, then lost the big prize: Winfield Scott in 1852, George McClellan in 1864, Winfield Scott Hancock in 1880. The most recent general to campaign for the presidency was Wesley Clark in 2004.So what are the chances of another military leader running for — let alone winning — the White House in 2016? Slim.Still, they’re not as slim as usual.If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, disaffected conservatives may feel compelled to draft a candidate for a third-party bid. Trump’s advisers have also  suggested that he may pick a general as his running mate  to reinforce his outsider persona while shoring up his shaky national-security credentials.On the other hand, if Trump is not the nominee, that means the convention in Cleveland will have been contested — which also means that  dark-horse candidates would have had a shot for the first time since 1952  . At least one military leader — retired four-star Gen. James Mattis — is already being floated as a possible white knight.A closer look at Mattis and three other potentially presidential (or vice-presidential) military men:James Mattis:  Known as both “Mad Dog Mattis” and “Warrior Monk,” Mattis — who last served as head of United States Central Command — is famous for two things: his impolitic remarks and his ascetic, intellectual air. Mattis’ personal library once included more than 7,000 volumes. He published required reading lists for Marines under his command. And he never goes anywhere without a copy of “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius. At the same time, Mattis has also said things like, “ You know, it’s a hell of a hoot. It’s fun to shoot some people.” This mix of politically incorrectness and brilliance both on and off the battlefield has beguiled many conservatives —  including Weekly Standard editor William Kristol  — and led to calls for a third-party bid. (A group of billionaires  has even tried to draft him  .) As for Mattis, he says he “hasn’t given any thought” to running.Stanley McChrystal:  These days, McChrystal is most famous for being forced to resign from his post as commander in Afghanistan after he and his aides made unflattering remarks about Vice President Joe Biden and other administration officials to Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings. But before that episode, McChrystal — who commanded the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) for five years in the mid-2000s and personally directed special ops in Iraq —was known as one of America’s craftiest and most effective military leaders. (His forces were responsible for the death of al-Qaida leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.) In retirement, McChrystal has taught a leadership seminar at Yale University, served on several corporate boards and advocated for a national-service program. According to various reports, he runs 7 or 8 miles a day, eats one meal a day and sleeps four hours a night. Ultimately, McChrystal may still be too controversial to join either party’s ticket; he has also been criticized for his involvement in Abu Ghraib and the Pat Tillman cover-up.William McRaven:  A jut-jawed former Navy admiral, McRaven succeed McChrystal as JSOC commander in 2008; during his 37-year military career, he commanded at every level within the special operations community. But McRaven’s most important mission came in 2011: Operation Neptune Spear. On Jan. 29 of that year, it was McRaven who began to plan “finish options” for Osama bin Laden; on May 1, it was McRaven, linked by secure video to the White House, who got to deliver the news that bin Laden was “EKIA” — enemy killed in action. McRaven’s personal story is inspiring as well: As a 45-year-old Navy SEAL captain, he was badly injured by his own parachute after a collision with another commando during a jump exercise in San Diego. “When it opened, it split me like a nutcracker, I guess, and just kind of broke the pelvis, broke my back,“ McRaven once told Time. It took him months to recover. McRaven currently serves as chancellor of the University of Texas System and reportedly leans left. Still, in a  recent op-ed  , he complained that “political correctness and pressure from Capitol Hill [have] undermined command authority and good order and discipline.”Mike Mullen:  Another retired Navy admiral, Mullen served as the 17th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from Oct. 1, 2007, to Sept. 30, 2011. In that role, he led the military into a new era of tolerance toward gays and lesbians by supporting and then implementing the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”“It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do,” Mullen said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. “No matter how I look at the issue … I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens. … For me, it comes down to integrity — theirs as individuals and ours as an institution.” According to the Washington Post’s David Ignatius  , “Officers who served with Mullen say he had a rare ability to unite the military and represent it to the country. His manner is low-key and cannily reserved, a bit like that of Eisenhower, another officer with the knack for managing difficult personalities.”Also worth noting: Mullen’s mother was comedian Jimmy Durante’s assistant; his father was a Hollywood press agent. When running for president, it never hurts to have Tinseltown connections.__________A cautionary tale for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or whoever wins this year’s Republican nomination after what promises to be one of the most bizarre and bitterly divided primaries in recent memory: The only way a Republican can possibly hope to win in November is if he unifies the GOP.Take 1964. In an obscure book called “Suite 3505” (about which we’ve previously written), legendary conservative strategist and Draft Goldwater mastermind F. Clifton White vividly recounts Barry Goldwater’s famous acceptance speech at that year’s GOP convention — in particular, the line that would come to define the senator’s career.“I would remind you that extremism in defense of liberty is no vice,” Goldwater said from the podium. “And let me remind you also that moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue.”We here at Unconventional always thought this passage was received favorably, as a clarion call of sorts for the new GOP. But in the context of the time — when the party was badly divided after a brutal primary contest — that’s not how it sounded to Goldwater’s savviest supporters.“In the trailer, I sat stunned as I listened to those words,” White writes. “I had not seen the speech beforehand, nor had any of the men working with me. But none of us had ever expected such a seemingly carefully calculated rebuff to the moderates and liberals within our party and to the millions we had hoped to draw to our cause.”“Inside the Cow Palace the crowd cheered insanely,” White continues, “and I wondered if they knew they were hailing disaster and defeat.”_____For the latest data, make sure to check the Yahoo News   delegate scorecard and primary calendar  ."
Illinois politician’s brother identifies himself as victim of Dennis Hastert,360,"Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert arrives at the federal courthouse in Chicago Wednesday for his sentencing on federal banking charges, which he pleaded guilty to last year. (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)In an emotional courtroom appearance, one of the previously anonymous victims accusing former House Speaker Dennis Hastert of sexual abuse identified himself as the brother of Hastert’s political protégé, former Illinois House Republican Leader Tom Cross.Scott Cross, 53, who had previously been known in court documents only as “Individual D,” said the sexual assault occurred decades ago when he was a Yorkville High School wrestler and Hastert was his coach, according to local media.Chicago-based reporters, including the News York Times’ Julie Bosman and Fox News’ Chad Pergram, were in the Chicago federal courtroom to live-tweet Hastert’s sentencing hearing. According to the reporters, Cross said the one-time incident in the boys’ locker room consisted of Hastert pulling down Cross’ shorts and grabbing his penis while giving him a massage, which was ostensibly intended to help him lose weight. Up until that point, Cross said, he had respected and trusted his coach, but he had to seek professional help for the trauma afterward.WBBM-TV reports that Cross did not tell his parents about the incident until last year, when Hastert was in court facing allegations that he had paid another victim hush money. Hastert actually called Cross’ brother to ask if he would write a letter of support. His defense team acknowledged the call and suggested that Hastert’s compartmentalization must have enabled him to ask the brother of a victim for help, according to the CBS affiliate.When asked if he had ever sexually abused Cross, Hastert reportedly said that he did not remember the incident.CBS Chicago reporter Audrina Bigos obtained the following statement released by Cross’ family shortly after his testimony:“We are very proud of Scott for having the courage to relive this very painful part of his life in order to ensure that justice is done today. We hope his testimony will provide courage and strength to other victims of other cases of abuse to speak out and advocate for themselves. With his testimony concluded, we ask now that you respect Scott’s privacy and that of our family.”The Chicago Tribune reports that Cross wrestled for Yorkville High School for four years, became the team’s captain his senior year and also participated in baseball and cross-country. He graduated in 1980, the year before Hastert left the school after being elected state representative. Afterward, they would often run into each other as Cross’ brother pursued a life in politics and turned to Hastert for guidance.Slideshow: A look back at Dennis Hastert’s career >>>Illinois House Minority Leader Tom Cross speaks to reporters at the state Capitol in September 2012. (Photo: Seth Perlman/AP)Jolene Burdge also took the stand to testify on behalf of her brother, Stephen Reinboldt, who was allegedly abused by Hastert and died of AIDS in 1995.“Don’t be a coward. … Tell the truth,” she said, according to the Associated Press. “I hope I have been your worst nightmare.”Federal Judge Thomas Durkin delivered a long statement before announcing the sentence, repeatedly calling Hastert a “serial child molester” and a “liar.” Noting that Hastert could not be charged with child sexual abuse because the statute of limitations for those crimes had ended, the judge sentenced Hastert to 15 months in federal prison and two years of supervised release for illegally structuring bank transactions to cover up payments to Reinboldt.Bosman reported the judge’s final words before exiting the courtroom: “This is a horrible case … horrible for our country. I hope I never have to see a case like this again.”"
Did Mary Pat Christie roll her eyes during Donald Trump’s ‘woman card’ comments?,689,"Mary Pat Christie offers what appears to be a sarcastic side glance during Donald Trump’s comments about women. (Screengrab via CNN)Following his five-state sweep of the Republican primaries on Tuesday night, Donald Trump raised more than a few eyebrows by accusing Hillary Clinton of playing the “woman card” in her bid for the Democratic nomination.“Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5 percent of the vote,” Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower in New York City. “The only thing she’s got going is the woman’s card. And the beautiful thing is, women don’t like her.”Mary Pat Christie, the wife of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, appeared to roll her eyes at Trump as she stood behind him onstage.And her eye roll did not go unnoticed online.During her husband’s failed bid for the GOP nomination, Christie was often asked about her family’s close relationship with the Trumps — and the first lady of New Jersey was careful to avoid dissing the billionaire real estate mogul.“Donald and Melania are friends,” she said on Fox News last year. “And he’s been an incredible businessman. So I think it’s honorable [for him] to put his hat in the ring [and] talk about the serious issues facing this country.”"
A tired-sounding Donald Trump turns his attention to Hillary Clinton and her ‘woman card’,1365,"Fresh off his five-state sweep in Tuesday’s Republican presidential primaries, Donald Trump took a victory lap on the morning talk show circuit in a series of phone interviews — his first since proclaiming himself the party’s “presumptive nominee.”On CNN’s “New Day,” a tired-sounding Trump said he was up late celebrating.“You sound pretty beat this morning,” host Chris Cuomo remarked.“I’m not beat,” the real estate mogul replied. “But I was up late last night, I will say that.”Following his latest series of victories, Trump said he has already made the turn toward sounding more “presidential.”“I can change to presidential, but I’m presidential anyway,” the brash billionaire said. “I view presidential just being a lower-key version of myself and being sure not to use any language that would be offensive, but I don’t do that anyway. I feel that I shouldn’t be doing that. I was doing that for a period of time for emphasis, but I feel that I shouldn’t be doing that.”But Trump also said he’s not sure what his tone will be in the general election should he become the GOP nominee.“You know, I may tone it down or I may tone it up. I can’t tell you what I’m going to do. I don’t know,” the former “Celebrity Apprentice” host explained. “Depends. You know, I use the word ‘flexibility.’ You have to be flexible. … Somebody said, ‘Well, will you go this way or that way?’ I don’t know. I will determine when I see how the other people punch back.”Some of that counterpunching may have already begun. During her victory speech in Philadelphia Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton responded to Trump’s claim that she is pandering to female voters.“Now, the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the ‘woman card,’” Clinton said. “Well, if fighting for women’s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the ‘woman card,’ then deal me in.”Trump, though, refused to back away from that line of attack.“I haven’t quite recovered — it’s early in the morning — from her shouting that message,” Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “A lot of people would say, ‘Well, you can’t say that about a woman because of course a woman doesn’t shout.’ But the way she shouted that message was not… That was the way she said it. I guess I’ll have to get used to that over the next four or five months.”Trump said Clinton did not push her “woman card” when she ran against Barack Obama in 2008.“She’s playing the woman card left and right,” Trump said on CNN. “She didn’t play it last time with Obama, but she’s playing it much harder this time, and she will be called on it.”During his primary night press conference, Trump said if Clinton “were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5 percent of the vote.”On ABC’s “Good Morning America” Wednesday, he dismissed critics who called the comments sexist.“It’s not sexist,” Trump said. “It’s true.”ABC’s George Stephanopoulos correctly noted that most national polls show Clinton does better with women than Trump.“Well, I mean that’s OK,” Trump said. “I haven’t started on her yet.”On “Morning Joe,” the Republican frontrunner offered what could be a preview of his forthcoming playbook.“Bernie Sanders has a message that’s interesting,” Trump said. “I’m going to be taking a lot of things Bernie said and using them.”"

Hillary Clinton on Donald Trump’s accusation she’s playing the ‘woman card’: ‘Deal me in’,3791,"Hillary Clinton has a response to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump’s claim that she is pandering to female voters.“Now the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the ‘woman card,'” Clinton said during her primary night rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. “Well, if fighting for women’s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the ‘woman card,’ then deal me in.”Trump made the accusation in an interview with Fox News over the weekend.“The only thing she’s got is the woman card,” Trump said. “I’d love to see a woman president, but she’s the wrong person. She’s a disaster.”At an MSNBC town hall on Monday, Clinton pledged that if she’s elected president, at least half of her Cabinet will be women.“Well, I am going to have a Cabinet that looks like America,” the former secretary of state said. “And 50 percent of America is women, right?”And last week, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said that the Democratic frontrunner’s shortlist of potential running mates will include women, quickly leading to speculation that Clinton will consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a popular progressive, for an all-female ticket.“We’ll start with a broad list and then begin to narrow it,” Podesta told the Boston Globe. “But there is no question that there will be women on that list.”Trump speaks as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie looks on during a primary night event in New York City on Tuesday. (Photo: Carlo Allegri/Reuters)During a press conference following Trump’s five-state sweep Tuesday night, he brought up the “woman card” again.“Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5 percent of the vote,” he said. “The only thing she’s got going is the woman’s card. And the beautiful thing is, women don’t like her.”Mary Pat Christie, the wife of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, appeared to throw some shade at Trump as she stood behind him on stage.On the second point, though, he’s right. According to an average of recent polls conducted by the Intercept, Clinton has a net favorable/unfavorable rating of minus 4.6 percent among women. But Trump’s average net favorability among women is minus 32.8 percent — likely a historic low for any major presidential candidate.And an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted last month found that in a hypothetical general matchup against Clinton, the brash billionaire would lose the women’s vote by 21 points.For Trump, the “beautiful thing” about Clinton’s “woman card” may prove to be ugly in November."
Trump’s ‘very good’ night: ‘I consider myself the presumptive nominee’,3106,"NEW YORK — Donald Trump took another step toward clinching the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday, easily sweeping Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut in the latest round of GOP primaries.But Trump’s victories, while commanding, did not bring an end to the Republican contest. Though the real estate mogul and former reality television star was expected to take home the majority of the 172 delegates at stake in Tuesday’s voting, adding to his already sizable lead, Pennsylvania’s delegate rules stopped Trump from making a clean sweep.While Trump won Pennsylvania’s statewide vote, clinching 17 of the state’s 71 delegates, another 54 were officially “unbound,” meaning they can make their own decision about which candidate to support at the party’s convention in July in Cleveland. That technicality gave a glimmer of hope to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who are trying to stop Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination before the convention.Donald Trump at his election night event on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Slideshow: Primary day in 5 Northeastern states >>>Still, Trump characterized his wins Tuesday as proof of his unstoppable momentum. Speaking to reporters at his election night event at Trump Tower, the GOP frontrunner said he considered the race “effectively over” because Cruz and Kasich “cannot win.”“I consider myself the presumptive nominee,” Trump said. “If you look honestly, Sen. Cruz and Gov. Kasich should really get out of the race. … They should get out of the race, and we should heal the Republican Party.”Although Trump now leads Cruz by more than 300 delegates, neither the Texas senator nor Kasich seems interested in ending his quest for the White House. The contest now shifts to Indiana, a state that could make or break the #NeverTrump movement.There, Trump narrowly leads Cruz in a state that is viewed as friendly territory for the Texas senator. And on Tuesday night, Cruz took his campaign to the New Castle Fieldhouse, the legendary home of the Indiana Hoosiers basketball team, where he cast himself as an underdog unwilling to give up the fight.“Tonight, this campaign moves back toward favorable terrain,” Cruz declared. “There is nothing Hoosiers cannot do.” Republican U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz speaks to supporters during his five state primary night rally in Knightstown, Indiana.   (Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)When Trump heads to Indiana on Wednesday, he will attempt to one-up Cruz in terms of basketball pandering. He plans to campaign with former Hoosiers coach Bobby Knight, a beloved sports figure in the state who endorsed Trump several months ago.But Trump will first make a stop in Washington, D.C., where he’s scheduled to deliver a foreign policy speech — the first of several policy speeches he has promised to make as he attempts to transition from a primary to a general election candidate.The candidate declined to go into specifics of what exactly he would talk about Wednesday. But he did reject the idea that he will tone down his rhetoric — pushing back on his convention manager Paul Manafort’s comments to members of the Republican National Committee last week that suggested Trump is merely playing “a part” and would embrace a more “presidential” tone in the coming weeks.“I am me. I am not playing a part,” Trump said Tuesday night, adding that he had received dozens of messages from supporters saying, “Please don’t change, please don’t change.” “If you have a football team, and you are winning … why would I change?” he said."

"Ted Cruz bricks ‘Hoosiers’ speech in Indiana, calls hoop a ‘basketball ring’",2138,"While Republican frontrunner Donald Trump celebrated his five-state sweep in Tuesday’s Republican primaries, Ted Cruz held a rally in Indiana inside the gym where “Hoosiers” was shot.But while expressing his love for the classic 1986 sports film, the Texas senator stumbled with some simple basketball terminology, referring to the hoop as a “ring.”“The amazing thing is, that basketball ring in Indiana,” Cruz told the crowd inside Hoosier Gym in Knightstown while recreating one of the movie’s iconic scenes, “it’s the same height as it is in New York City and every other place in this country.”Except it’s not called a “ring"" — not in Indiana, New York City or anywhere else in this country.Ted Cruz speaks during a rally at Hoosier Gym in Knightstown, Ind., on Tuesday.

John Dingell was among them.Of course, when it comes to politicians making sports gaffes, Cruz isn’t alone.John Kerry once infamously referred to Lambeau Field, the Green Bay Packers’ home stadium, as “Lambert Field.”And earlier this month, Trump asked the crowd at a rally in Pittsburgh, “How’s Joe Paterno?”Paterno, the legendary Penn State football coach, died in 2012."
"Big wins by Trump, Clinton give rivals little breathing room",761,"By James OliphantINDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton rolled up wins in Northeastern states on Tuesday in a major show of strength and immediately turned their fire on each other in a possible preview of a general election matchup.The New York billionaire easily defeated rivals John Kasich and Ted Cruz in all five states that held contests, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, with a margin of victory rivaling that of his home state of New York a week ago. He was on a path to winning the vote in every county in each state.Clinton, already in control of the Democratic race, defeated challenger Bernie Sanders in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Her only loss of the night was to Sanders in Rhode Island.The race now pivots immediately to Indiana, which is shaping up to be Cruz’s best, and perhaps last, chance to slow Trump’s momentum toward the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama.If Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, can win a large share of the state’s 57 delegates on May 3, it will boost the chances that Trump will not be able to amass the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination before the party’s convention in July. That could give Cruz a shot at convincing delegates to back him for president instead.A loss to Trump in Indiana would effectively cripple Cruz’s already faltering bid, and increase pressure on the party to rally around Trump as the prospective nominee.Katie Packer, head of the anti-Trump political-action committee Our Principles, said her organization would be active in the state with “TV, mail, phones, digital, all of it.”“We’re going to be playing in a lot of different congressional districts,” Packer said.The Club for Growth, a conservative pro-business group, has bought $1.5 million worth of anti-Trump TV ads in the state.Both groups worked to hand Trump a defeat at the hands of Cruz earlier this month in Wisconsin.“Tonight, this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain,” Cruz said in Knightstown, Indiana on Tuesday.‘DEAL ME IN’Back on the East Coast, Trump and Clinton used victory rallies to snipe at each other in the kind of back and forth that will take place should they win their party’s presidential nominations and face off in the general election campaign.“I think she’s a flawed candidate and she’s going to be easy to beat,” Trump told a news conference at New York’s Trump Tower.Trump, who is to give a foreign policy speech in Washington on Wednesday, criticized Clinton’s record as secretary of state and her vote as a U.S. senator from New York in support of the Iraq war. He said her only advantage was as a woman seeking to become the first female U.S. president.“Frankly if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5 percent of the vote,” he said.Clinton, in a victory speech in Philadelphia, took aim at Trump for accusing her of trying to “play the woman card.”“Well if fighting for women’s healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in,” she said to cheers.Of 118 committed delegates available on Tuesday, the Associated Press said Trump took 105, raising his total delegates to 950. Kasich, the Ohio governor, won five, all from Rhode Island, and Cruz one, with seven delegates still to be assigned. Pennsylvania’s 54 unbound delegates will become clearer later.Projecting confidence, Trump said it was time for Cruz and Kasich to get out of the race so the party can unify behind him. He also urged Sanders’ voters to support him.“I consider myself the presumptive nominee,” he said, adding later: “As far as I’m concerned, this thing is over.”Clinton’s strong showing in the Democratic race added to the pressure on Sanders to get out of the race or ease his criticism of her.In her speech, Clinton gave a nod to Sanders and spoke of the need for party unity.“Whether you support Senator Sanders or you support me, there is much more that unites us than divides us,” she said.Clinton’s victories on Tuesday gave her 2,141 delegates, according to the AP, pushing her closer to the 2,383 needed for the nomination. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told reporters earlier on Tuesday he did not think Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, had a realistic path to winning the nomination.Sanders, in a speech in Huntington, West Virginia, and a subsequent statement, showed no signs of getting out of the race. He is expected to campaign in Indiana.“The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be. That’s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast,” he said in his statement.(Reporting by James Oliphant in Indianapolis and Emily Stephenson, Jeff Mason, Megan Cassella and Alana Wise in Washington; Writing by Steve Holland and James Oliphant; Editing by Peter Cooney.)"
Clinton has another big night and is poised to become first female major party presidential nominee,5657,"PHILADELPHIA — Hillary Clinton is on the verge of victory in the Democratic presidential primary, winning in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Delaware on Tuesday night. Her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, won in Rhode Island. Clinton already appeared to be on the path toward clinching the race and becoming the first female major party presidential nominee on April 19, when she earned a victory in her home state of New York. At that point, Sanders was left with an extremely slim chance of earning enough delegates to secure the party’s nomination. Tonight, that possibility all but closed.Even before Clinton’s four victories, Sanders needed to win every remaining state in the Democratic primary by more than 13 points to surpass her in delegates, a scenario that no polls have predicted. Clinton would be the first female presidential nominee from the Democratic or Republican Party. Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters during her primary night rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. (Photo: Charles Mostoller/Reuters)At the Philadelphia Convention Center, Clinton took the stage to the song “Eye of the Tiger.” In a nod to the movie “Rocky,” which is set in the city, she declared the evening a “great night” and looked ahead to the official end of the primary process. “With your help, we’re going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates,” Clinton said. “And we will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together, an America where we lift each other up instead of tearing each other down.”Clinton’s remarks included several lines that have not been in her standard stump speech thus far, in which she acknowledged the surprisingly strong challenge Sanders has mounted and some of the core issues of his platform. After starting as a long shot, Sanders earned a string of victories against Clinton by painting her as insufficiently progressive and criticizing her ties to Wall Street and corporate megadonors. In her speech, Clinton argued that Democrats are largely in agreement on these issues.“We will build on a strong progressive tradition, from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama, and I applaud Sen. Sanders and his millions of supporters for challenging us to get unaccountable money out of our politics and to give greater emphasis to closing the gap of inequality,” Clinton said. “I know together we will get that done, because whether you support Sen. Sanders or you support me, there’s much more that unites us than divides us.” After the speech, Clinton’s campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri spoke to Yahoo News. Palmieri discussed the Democratic primary in the past tense.“We had a number of wins tonight. We’re very grateful for them. It’s more clear that she’ll be the nominee. She’s grateful to have won the state of Pennsylvania and to be coming back here in 14 weeks to accept her party’s nomination,” Palmieri said, adding, “We are looking back now on the primary … we’re winding down. We have — there’s, I believe, seven weeks left to go in a process that’s been going on for a year. And, as we look back on how the primary unfolded … the process, we believe was to our party’s benefit and to our campaign’s benefit.” Palmieri said the primary made Clinton a “more tested, stronger candidate” and also left the Democratic Party “positioned well for the general.”“The issues that were raised in our primary and the issues that brought more than 10 million voters out to vote for Hillary Clinton are the same economic issues that we think are going to be forefront in the general election and on the minds of general election voters,” said Palmieri. “So, that is, how do you increase wages? How do you create jobs? How can you help people afford college? How can you make their health care more affordable?”Palmieri went on to argue that there was no need for Clinton’s campaign to “make a general election pivot” and “talk about different issues.” “For the Democrats, that’s what our primary has been about. It’s been about the same kind of economic issues, as well as issues of national security, that we think voters across the board care about,” Palmieri said.On the other side of the aisle, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump earned a sweep on Tuesday night, with wins in all five states. Yahoo News asked Palmieri if the Clinton campaign would be glad to face Trump in the general election rather than another GOP candidate. “That is on the list of things I have no control over. We will deal with … whoever they choose,” Palmieri said. “But whoever they choose, their personalities might be different, but they are similar on issues Hillary Clinton laid out tonight. They all want to overturn Roe v. Wade, none of them believe that we should raise the minimum wage, they’re not going to combat climate change, not going to fight to overturn Citizens United.”Heading into Tuesday’s contests, the Sanders campaign indicated this would be a pivotal turning point in the Democratic race. In an interview with the New York Times, Sanders’ senior adviser, Tad Devine, said his team would re-examine its approach based on the night’s returns. However, Devine was clear that Sanders would remain in the running, no matter what.“If we are sitting here and there’s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be upfront about that,” Devine said. “If we have a really good day, we are going to continue to talk about winning most of the pledged delegates, because we will be on a path toward it. If we don’t get enough today to make it clear that we can do it by the end, it’s going to be hard to talk about it. That’s not going to be a credible path. Instead, we will talk about what we intend to do between now and the end, and how we can get there.”Slideshow: Primary day in 5 Northeastern states >>>Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, walk to the stage at her election night rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

Sanders also pointed to poll results to make the case he would perform better than Clinton in the general election, an argument his campaign has made as it attempts to persuade delegates to switch sides. He referred to national polls that show him performing better against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump than Clinton does and indications that he has greater support from independents.“That is the point that I hope the delegates to the Democratic convention fully understand,” he said. “In the general election, everyone, Democrat and Republican, has a right to vote for the president.”Sanders did not criticize Clinton for her ties to Wall Street or paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, although he has brought up those issues throughout his campaign, including just last week.

United States to adopt bison as national mammal,15337,"Bison are on track to become the United States’ national mammal. (Photo: Julie Larsen Maher/Wildlife Conservation Society)They want to preserve a home where the buffalo roam.The U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Bison Legacy Act Tuesday to make the American bison the official national mammal, and the Senate is expected to adopt the bill later this week. Afterward, all that’s needed is President Obama’s John Hancock.Under the bill, the first Saturday of November will be dubbed National Bison Day, giving conservationists a designated day to celebrate the animal and raise its profile among the general population. The bill does not affect any policy or action by the federal government.“It’s a way to do good things for bison in North America without a massive regulatory hammer. It’s a symbolic thing, but it really brings a lot of opportunities to raise the profile of this species for the American public,” Keith Aune, director of the bison conservation program for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in an interview with Yahoo Politics.According to the National Bison Legacy Act, Congress finds “bison can play an important role in improving the types of grasses found in landscapes to the benefit of grasslands.” (Photo: Julie Larsen Maher/Wildlife Conservation Society)To justify the newfound status, Congress listed, among many reasons, the historical use of bison as a symbol of the United States and the mammal’s links to the economic and spiritual lives of many Native American tribes.Bison are considered the first major conservation success story on earth. At the turn of the 20th century, the bison population had dwindled to about 1,000. Concerned citizens, including American icon and President Teddy Roosevelt, formed the American Bison Society to help relocate 15 bison from the Bronx Zoo to a refuge in Oklahoma, from which the animal could start to repopulate the West.Aune said the conservation effort moved along slowly at first, but a wave of commercial interest propelled it forward in the mid-20th century.“We know they are a healthy red meat that’s low in cholesterol and high in omega-3s. There are commercial bison in all 50 states, privately owned for meat production,” he said.The Wildlife Conservation Society continues to work on growing the bison population in the West alongside the InterTribal Buffalo Council and the National Bison Association. These organizations are interested in preserving the mammal for cultural reasons and for ranching and production purposes, respectively.But, Aune said, the conservationists realized that many Americans are not terribly familiar with bison and do not feel a particular connection with them. The National Bison Legacy Act might rally more people around their cause. Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., introduced the bill on June 25, 2015. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., has called a press conference for Friday morning where he’s expected to announce that the bill is more or less a done deal.  "
How a Black Lives Matter activist lost his battle for City Hall in Baltimore,777,"Activist DeRay Mckesson ran for mayor in Baltimore. (Photo: Andre Chung for the Washington Post via Getty Images)BALTIMORE — There was one moment during protests in Ferguson, Mo., when DeRay Mckesson says he feared a casual gesture might cost him his life.According to Mckesson, the incident occurred in the first few days of the demonstrations that engulfed the city following the Aug. 9, 2014, shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson cop. Mckesson said the protesters were suddenly rushed by one of the police forces who were aggressively cracking down on the nightly unrest. As the cops surged in, Mckesson said, the crowd dispersed — and his phone cord began to fall from his pocket as he ran.In the weeks of protests that followed Brown’s death, the demonstrators frequently ran with their hands up. It was an effort to dramatize the gesture of surrender Brown allegedly made before he was shot. The posture was also a precaution for the protesters who didn’t want to join Brown and the other young black men who have died after being perceived as threats by police officers. With his phone cord slipping out of his shorts, Mckesson found himself making a crucial choice — should he lower his hands to secure the charger, or would moving toward his pocket get him shot?Mckesson told Yahoo News he went for the cord because he “won’t live in fear.” He recounted the moment when he spoke to a room of students at University of Maryland, Baltimore County last Friday and explained why he decided to go from protesting against the system to trying to become part of it.One of the most high-profile figures in the Black Lives Matter movement, Mckesson, a 30-year-old who was born in Baltimore, spent three months running a long-shot — and ultimately unsuccessful — campaign for mayor of his hometown. His bid ended Tuesday, when he finished in sixth place in the Democratic primary with a little over 3,000 votes, or 2 percent of the total. Maryland State Senate Majority Leader Catherine Pugh won the race with 45,360 votes. In his unlikely effort to bring the movement from the streets to City Hall, Mckesson, wearing his distinctive blue vest, tried to turn the name he made for himself documenting the unrest in Ferguson into a springboard to leading a city facing similar strife.Starting last April 18, riots rocked Baltimore after it was revealed Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man, suffered severe spinal injuries while being taken into police custody. Gray eventually died as a result of his injuries, and the state’s attorney filed criminal charges against the six officers who were involved in his death. The case is still ongoing, but the initial reaction in the city led to a state of emergency, curfews, and the National Guard being called in. Mckesson, who had previously returned to the city, was on the streets during the upheaval.A protester faces police who hurled smoke grenades and fired pepper balls at demonstrators to enforce a citywide curfew in Baltimore on April 28, 2015. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a Democrat, faced intense criticism for her handling of the riots, and last December, she announced she would not seek reelection. Her decision set the stage for the crowded race featuring Mckesson and 12 other candidates in Tuesday’s Democratic mayoral primary. And in a city where the electorate is overwhelmingly registered in the party, that primary contest was tantamount to the general election.At a town hall on Saturday, President Obama praised Black Lives Matter for being “really effective in bringing attention to problems” of racial injustice. But, he suggested, the group “can’t just keep on yelling.”“The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room,” Obama said.Mckesson clearly is making an effort to bring Black Lives Matter out of the streets and into the halls of power. With a majority of African-American residents and clear concerns about law enforcement in the community, Baltimore seems like the ideal setting for that effort. However, Mckesson’s campaign faced a unique set of obstacles due to his prominence in the movement, and his bid seems to have resonated more with rich Baltimoreans than residents of poor black neighborhoods, where many have abandoned electoral politics. Yahoo News spent three days with Mckesson and his team last week and saw firsthand what he aimed to do and why it was ultimately unsuccessful.Speaking to the students at UMBC last week, Mckesson explained some of his rationale for running for office. He contrasted this perspective with that of others in the movement, whom he described as “addicted” to protesting rather than working within the system.“We also need to be the people who are on the boards and commissions … in actual power. The status quo that we are resisting is super organized on the inside, and an outside-only strategy, I think, is not a strategy to win. I think it’s a strategy to fight forever and ever,” Mckesson explained. “Our goal is not to fight forever and ever, and I do worry that, in the movement space, that there are people more addicted to fighting than winning.”Mckesson defined this dichotomy as “a split around reform and revolution that happens in the movement” with revolutionaries fighting for “100-year goals,” such as establishing new political parties, in lieu of bringing “change today and tomorrow.”Mckesson, who regularly described his mayoral campaign platform as being focused on “concrete change,” has no problem being identified as a reformer rather than a revolutionary. He believes long-term political goals should be pursued in conjunction with realistic programs for criminal justice reform, education, and affordable housing, he told the UMBC students.“If getting more people out of jail makes me a reformer, then like, I’m all about it. Right? And if ending cash bail tomorrow is like, ‘I’m a reformer,’ then fine, right?” he said.Mckesson is arrested in Missouri in August 2015. (Photo: Jeff Roberson/AP)Mckesson burst onto the national scene by documenting the Ferguson protests on social media and in a newsletter. When Brown died, Mckesson was living in Minneapolis, where he worked as the director of human capital with the city’s public school system. Mckesson says he decided to drive to Ferguson in an attempt to square the different narratives he was seeing on Twitter and television, and said that being hit with tear gas inspired him to join the protests. He basically never left.During the first half of last year, Mckesson traveled around the country to cities where young African-Americans died at the hands of the police, and other locations where protests erupted — such as Charleston, S.C., where a white supremacist killed nine people at a black church, and Missouri, where racial issues led to mass demonstrations at the state’s flagship public university. Along with participating in protests, Mckesson helped found a group that crafted a Black Lives Matter policy agenda. Though he was not part of the organization that originally coined the phrase, Mckesson’s relentless tweets and trademark blue Patagonia vest eventually made him one of the most recognizable faces of the movement, and drew in more than 340,000 Twitter followers.Mckesson’s past as a high-profile protester gave him unusual resources for a first-time candidate. But at the same time, his visibility within Black Lives Matter movement generated a harsh spotlight, including backlash from other activists. And while Mckesson’s unique brand of political celebrity brought him donations from all 50 states, high-powered allies and intense national press coverage, his sixth place finish showed these things didn’t’ translate into the support necessary to win the race.While it fueled national interest in his campaign, Black Lives Matter wasn’t been the central element of Mckesson’s pitch to Baltimore voters.He spent much more of his time talking about his background as a teacher with high-level administrative roles at large public education agencies. In addition to his position with the school system in Minneapolis, Mckesson worked in human capital for Baltimore City Public Schools from August 2011 until the end of 2013. He also helped lead an afterschool program in Baltimore a few years after his 2007 graduation from Bowdoin College.And police reform is only a small portion of his platform, which is largely focused on a series of what he describes as “tangible things that we can do that might not be the most sexy.”Among other things, Mckesson wanted to get mayoral control over city schools and, in the meantime, establish adult and childhood literacy programs. He wanted to employ strategies to fill Baltimore’s blighted blocks of vacant homes that are tailored to specific neighborhoods and coupled with a plan to address urban food deserts. He called for creating cultural opportunities for the city’s young people like movie theaters, arts programs, and dirt bike parks. And yes, Mckesson also talked about plans for crime and policing, including establishing needle exchanges, mandating drug tests for officers involved in shootings and banning chokeholds.Mckesson chats with campaign volunteers before canvassing in Baltimore in March. (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)Mckesson was the last high-profile Democratic candidate to officially enter the race. He filed his candidacy on the evening of Feb. 3, minutes before the deadline on the final day to register. On the campaign trail, Mckesson attributed his late entry to the time he spent putting together his platform and the difficulty of finding an election lawyer who was not already tied to one of the other candidates.“I spent a lot of time on the policy platform because I didn’t want to be a personality candidate,” Mckesson said to a crowd at a campaign event last Thursday night, adding, “Logistically, you know, there’s so many people running for office in this city that it actually took some time to find an election lawyer who was not conflicted.“This delay meant Mckesson had just 83 days to campaign, when many of his rivals had been running for months. The time crunch was exacerbated by the fact many Baltimoreans participated in early voting. And this wasn’t the last time Mckesson’s status as a political newcomer cost him.In his campaign appearances, Mckesson sounded something like a local version of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. He called himself “an outsider to the establishment” and “an insider to the city,” and touted the fact he has raised more than $200,000, largely from small donors. In fact, Mckesson used the same firm that helped rope in the online donations that have fueled Sanders’ insurgency in the presidential race. However, the money Mckesson raised was still far less than the funds raised by his top rivals, some of whom have seven-figure war chests. And his team, which included just three paid staffers, was much smaller than his opponents’ operations.While Mckesson’s activist career earned him meetings with President Obama, Sanders, and a slew of celebrities and Silicon Valley luminaries, he didn’t have the endorsement of a single local elected official. His campaign manager, Sharhonda Bossier, told Yahoo News Mckesson hasn’t sought “political favors from politicians.”“Our work has been rooted in connecting with as many voters as possible,” Bossier said.And Mckesson had a lot of work to do on that front. The last Baltimore Sun poll conducted before the election showed he had the support of  less than 1 percent of voters.Mckesson and his team argued the polls understated his following. They cited the unusually high turnout in early voting and the fact the mayoral race is coinciding with a presidential primary as reasons the electorate was fundamentally different than it has been in the past. Though he did outperform his rock bottom poll numbers, the surveys were clearly not too far off.In a conversation with Yahoo News three days before the election, Dr. Mileah Kromer, who directs the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Baltimore’s Goucher College, which conducts polling in Maryland, rejected the Mckesson campaign’s arguments about the polls. Kromer predicted Mckesson would beat the incredibly low expectations, but she said there were not enough unique factors in this year’s race for Mckesson to come from as far behind as he was. Both of the two frontrunners: former Mayor Sheila Dixon and the eventual winner, Pugh, were leading the pack with over 25 percent support in the polls.“While I do think there’s a real possibility for him to outperform the one percent which he’s polling at, I don’t think it will make up for the 30-point gap,” Kromer told Yahoo News.President Obama speaks at a meeting with civil rights leaders — including Mckesson, right — at the White House on Feb. 18. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP)Given his trailing position in polls, Mckesson drew few attacks from the top candidates. Neither the Pugh nor the Dixon campaign responded to requests from Yahoo News to comment about Mckesson. He has polled too low to even enter several debates, and Dixon, when initially asked about Mckesson’s candidacy, said she had never heard of him.While his actual opponents ignored him, Mckesson was under relentless attack online. He is constantly on his phone, fielding an exhausting stream of Twitter messages, including vicious insults from conservatives.Along with online sparring, Mckesson believed he took unfair hits in the press that discouraged voters from backing his campaign. His mayoral bid generated substantial coverage, but much of it focused on his poor poll numbers and background as a protester rather than his platform.Late last month, Mckesson began an effort to reach out to 30,000 voters in the final 30 days of his campaign. He told Yahoo News he far exceeded that goal with mailers, phone calls, events, and by knocking on nearly 2,000 doors per day with a combination of his staff, volunteers and paid canvassers. However, Mckesson didn’t believe he was credited for this ground work.Mckesson lamented the public perceptions surrounding his campaign when he spoke to the class at UMBC last week, saying people did not believe he was out meeting voters unless he documented it.“The social media presence is a good thing and a bad thing sometimes. It does a lot to amplify the message in a way that is powerful. The hard part is that if I don’t put it on Twitter, people like literally act like it doesn’t exist,” Mckesson said, adding, “No other candidate has to prove every single thing they do.”Some local activists were reluctant to embrace him, and view him as insufficiently tied to the community. This opposition has also drawn substantial attention in the press.Dr. Lawrence Brown, a local activist and professor at Baltimore’s historically black Morgan State University, attributed the critiques Mckesson has faced from other activists to the city’s “insular” nature.“Home grown — you know, born, raised, and what people call ’doing the work’ here, you know — it like really, really means a lot. And he was born and raised here, but people haven’t necessarily seen him doing the work … in terms of maybe activism or protesting, you know — being visible in that regard,” Brown told Yahoo News. “So I think, like, he’s being penalized for Baltimore’s very unique sense of insularity … not really wanting outsiders to get a lot of credit or to hog the limelight.”As a result of the bad press, Mckesson was guarded in the final days of the race. When Yahoo News asked him about the benefits and disadvantages of his high-profile association with Black Lives Matter, he barely answered the question.“The movement is made up of many people doing incredible work all across the country,” Mckesson said. “I’m proud to stand with them and I’m proud to be a part of this community. That’s my whole comment on the record.”In his defensive posture, Mckesson preferred to let his platform and campaign work speak for itself. He stuck to the details of his platform in almost all conversations. The data points tumbled out of him in a rapid-fire patter. His eagerness for people to hear the policies was apparent. Mckesson also wanted the world to know he was out pounding the pavement looking for votes — and to see the reaction he’s getting in his travels around the city.Mckesson and campaign staffer Maria Griffin canvass in the Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore in March. (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)Last Thursday and Friday, Yahoo News tagged along as Mckesson spoke to the UMBC college class, a group at a local senior citizens center, and a forum for young local leaders. Mckesson generally generated an enthusiastic response. On Friday evening, he visited the Federal Hill neighborhood and spent a few hours walking a stretch of more than half a mile that is densely populated with quaint brick homes, and he and his team knocked on hundreds of doors. Several people he encountered were familiar with his activism.“You’re a big deal! Thanks for stopping by!” said one man who seemed shocked to find Mckesson on his doorstep. “I admire your Twitter awesomeness actually. I really like your platform, and I’m a fan.”During the evening, one person shut the door on Mckesson, though they only did so after offering a terse, “Thanks!”A Johns Hopkins science professor ran into the street to meet Mckesson after hearing from his wife that the candidate was in the neighborhood.“She said you were out here, so I figured I’d come out and meet the celebrity,” the professor said.Like several other enthusiastic supporters, the professor alluded to the poll numbers and expressed hope that Mckesson would remain in the city and stay involved even if he lost the election.“You’re not going to disappear, right?” he asked.Though Mckesson said he had no “plans to move,” he noted he wanted to be “transparent” and said he desired an impactful position in local government, and was concerned he might not be able to attain one if he was defeated by certain unnamed rivals.“This is why I’m running for mayor, right? It’s like the one position that actually allows for you to have maximum impact,” Mckesson explained. “I think that … there are some people that, if they win, I won’t have a place.”The neighborhood where he made the rounds on Friday evening is a relatively well-off, mostly white section of the city. In her conversation with Yahoo News, Bossier, his campaign manager, acknowledged that wealthier Baltimoreans are a key part of Mckesson’s base.“The places where we didn’t have to do as much education around who he was … predominately white, middle-income communities. … People who watch MSNBC or are on Twitter and so know him from that and, like, read the New Yorker and so kind of know who he is from that kind of work,” Bossier said. She added, “And then middle-income and upper-income black folks know who he is — again, probably mostly because of his social media presence and activism.”Mckesson chats with bicyclists as he canvasses in Charles Village, Baltimore, in March. (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)In general, poor and minority voters tend to vote less, and Baltimore has had a recent history of especially low turnout that experts have attributed to  pessimism and apathy  among residents.Last Saturday, Yahoo News visited the Gilmor Homes, the public housing project where Freddie Gray lived before his fatal arrest. The development is located in Sandtown-Winchester, a neighborhood where the streets are dotted with vacant homes and the statistics are grim. Last year, the poverty rate in Sandtown-Winchester was over 30 percent, almost a quarter of people were out of work, and the murder rate was  almost twice the average for the rest of Baltimore  even as the number of homicides in the city hit record highs.The Gilmor Homes are a series of three-story apartments that open on to common areas. Some of the units are empty and boarded up. On Saturday, music blasted in the courtyard and people sat outside on stoops chatting with each other. Many of the residents we attempted to talk to declined to speak with us. None of the people we spoke to said they were aware of Mckesson, and almost all of them didn’t plan to vote.One man, who declined to give his last name or spell out his first, complained about the condition of his home and a lack of support from the housing authority.“I’m about to move out of here because they ain’t treating these people around here right, man. … Every time the mayor ask to shake your hand, they want to get voted. … They get voted in office … and you don’t see them no more,” the man said, adding, “There ain’t going to be no change … I’m going to change and get away from here.”Shawnrice Kelly sat nearby with her sister. She echoed the man’s sentiments.“I did vote. I did before, it ain’t interesting how it used to be when I was young, when I first started to vote. … I’m still going to be f***ed at the end, whatever who wins,” Kelly said. “Everything’s still going to be the same. They say they’re going to help. Of course you’re going to say what you say to get your votes, but nobody cares. You got to make it out of this jungle on your own.”Mckesson said he understands the “sense of disinvestment” among some voters in Baltimore’s poorer neighborhoods.“For so many people, the government has not proven itself to be a productive force,” Mckesson said. “In so many ways, the government needs … to prove itself to people so they can be invested again. And I’m ready to do that as mayor. I know that that work isn’t necessarily quick work. It’s the right work, and it doesn’t happen overnight.”Another man who spoke to Yahoo News in the Gilmor Houses and declined to give his name had no comment about the mayoral election. However, he did offer an observation on the national political scene.“I just came home from prison. I’m going to be honest: If the president of the United States becomes Donald Trump, it’s going to be hell out here,” the man said. “It’s already hell, but it’s going to transform into the real version.”If the man’s prediction comes true and “hell” breaks out in Baltimore this November, it’s safe to say we’ll see Mckesson there in the streets. However, for now, he’ll be there as a protester rather than a politician.This story was updated on April 27, 2016, at 2:18 p.m. to include the election results."
Trump’s campaign chief is questioned about ties to Russian billionaire,4341,"Paul Manafort on “Meet the Press” earlier this month. (Photo: William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images) A lawyer for Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s chief campaign aide, acknowledged Tuesday evening that the longtime GOP operative has been questioned by officials from the Cayman Islands in connection with a $26.2 million investment by a billionaire Russian oligarch who was his partner in an ill-fated telecommunications development in Ukraine. The lawyer’s comments came in response to an earlier story by Yahoo News about the Cayman officials’ efforts to track down Manafort for his testimony.The dispute goes back years, but last summer, court-appointed liquidators from the Cayman Islands initiated legal action in federal court in Alexandria, Va., seeking to question under oath Manafort and two business partners about a business deal involving firms controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate who for years was barred from entering the United States over allegations of ties to organized crime.“These guys are chasing their money,” said Rick Davis, one of the partners subpoenaed in the case and the manager of John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “They [Deripaska’s firms] invested in something and it just went away. They are actually trying to track down where the company went and where the [money] went.”Richard Hibey, a lawyer for Manafort, emailed Yahoo News Tuesday night stating that “Mr. Manafort and others appeared for depositions some months ago and answered all questions,” mooting the legal action in Virginia, and added, “we are not privy to any other developments.” HIbey, however, declined to address any specifics about Manafort’s dealings with Deripaska, noting that since “the matter is pending in the Caymans, it would be inappropriate to discuss it.”Davis told Yahoo News that, through his lawyer, he informed the Cayman Island court officials that he knew nothing about the investment, even though Manafort’s company in the partnership with Deripaska, Davis Manafort International, still bears his name.In fact, Davis said, he hasn’t spoken to Manafort in more than five years, didn’t know how to reach him and was stunned to learn last year about Manafort’s side business investments with Deripaska, a controversial figure who — through Davis’ help — had met with McCain and other U.S. senators in 2006 during a time the Russian oligarch was seeking to persuade U.S. authorities to allow him to enter the United States.“I was like, what the f*** is this?” Davis recalled when he learned the Cayman Island court officials wanted to question him about the Ukrainian telecommunications investment. “I wasn’t involved in this thing.”In earlier court filings in the Caymans, Deripaska’s lawyers had alleged that Manafort and another of his business partners, Rick Gates (who also recently went to work for the Trump campaign), had failed to respond to repeated requests for audit reports or any other information about the Ukrainian investment funds put out by Deripaska. Gates also did not respond to a request for comment by Yahoo News. “It appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared,” Deripaska’s lawyers wrote in a petition to the Cayman Islands court filed in Dec. 4, 2014.Whatever the explanation, the court documents shed new light on a trail of complicated offshore business dealings (many of them through firms registered in the Cayman Islands, Cyprus and elsewhere) that Manafort engaged in with wealthy Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs — relationships he appears to have forged while serving as chief political consultant to former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin who fled Kiev in February 2014 and now lives in Moscow.These ties could prove problematic for Manafort, especially in light of a report today by Politico that Trump has increasing misgivings about his new top aide, who is trying to position the Republican frontrunner as a more conventional candidate. According to Politico, Trump also had concerns about Manafort’s past ties to controversial foreign figures like Yanukovych and, as reported by Yahoo News last week, to a Pakistani intelligence front group — associations that Trump was apparently unaware of when he hired him. A separate lawsuit filed in New York three years ago details multiple business deals that Manafort had with another pro-Putin oligarch, Dmitri Firtash, including plans to purchase New York’s Drake Hotel and develop a high-end resort on the Bahamian island of Bimini.The New York lawsuit, filed on behalf of former Ukranian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Yanukovych’s rival, alleged that Manafort’s business deals were part of a “racketeering” scheme to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through a “labyrinth” of Firtash-controlled companies in Panama, Cyprus and Europe for the benefit of Yanukovych.The lawsuit was tossed out by a federal judge in New York last fall on the grounds that it mainly involved overseas activity that was not within the jurisdiction of the court. But as part of the case, the lawyer for Tymoshenko, Kenneth F. McCallion, put into the court record documents detailing Manafort’s business arrangements with Firtash, including memos and emails about meetings between them in Kiev and a copy of an agreement to create a limited partnership with Firtash registered in the Cayman Islands that was signed by Manafort in April 2009. (Firtash two years ago was indicted by a federal grand jury in Chicago for alleged conspiracy to bribe Indian government officials for a titanium contract. He was arrested in Vienna, but the Austrian government rebuffed a Justice Department request for his extradition last year. The oligarch remains a federal fugitive with an outstanding Interpol warrant, afraid to risk arrest by leaving Austria, according to a source close to him.)During the same period that Manafort was pursuing the business deals with Firtash, he was also soliciting investments from Deripaska, according to the court petition filed by Deripaska’s lawyers in the Cayman Islands and, more recently, by the Cayman liquidators in Alexandria, Va.Long known as one of Putin’s favorite oligarchs, Deripaska made billions of dollars in the aluminum business in the 1990s, becoming one of Russia’s wealthiest men. But in 2006, the State Department, at the FBI’s request, revoked his visa to enter the United States because of concerns about allegations of corruption, bribery and possible ties to organized crime, which Deripaska denied.According to “Missing Man,” a forthcoming book by New York Times reporter Barry Meier, the FBI later relented and secretly arranged to have the Department of Homeland Security issue Deripaska a temporary visa in 2009, allowing him into the U.S. to meet with American business leaders after the oligarch promised he could help the bureau find Robert Levinson, a former bureau agent who has gone missing in Iran. But according to Meier’s book, Deripaska’s leads went nowhere and bureau officials determined they had been had by the Russian. The FBI concluded that Deripaska and two associates “were bullshit artists who had used Bob’s case as a means to try to get the United States to do what they wanted without ever delivering anything,” Meier writes.The court filings in Alexandria stem from an agreement in March 2007 to create a Cayman Islands partnership called Pericles Emerging Market Investors, between a firm owned by Manafort and Gates and Surf Horizon, described as a company incorporated that summer in Cyprus to serve as a special purpose vehicle for investments by one of Deripaska’s companies in Moscow. (Deripaska is not identified by name in the court filings, but sources directly familiar with the case told Yahoo News he was the principal figure with whom Manafort had partnered.)The partnership’s purpose was to “generate significant long-term capital appreciation” through private equity investments in Ukraine, Russia and elsewhere. As part of the deal, Deripaska’s firms paid $7.35 million in management fees to Manafort and Gates.But the deal went south after Pericles paid $18.9 million in 2008 to holdings in Cyprus controlled by Manafort and Gates for the purchase of Black Sea Cable, a Ukrainian holding company for telecommunications and Internet interests in that country. Citing the worldwide financial crisis that year, Deripaska’s firms later suspended further investments and the two parties agreed to wind down their partnership, according to the filing by Deripaska’s lawyers.Lawyers for the Russian oligarch then started seeking information — and audits — about what happened to the investment and the management fees Deripaska’s firms had paid. In court papers, they allege they discovered that the Ukranian investment had been structured differently than they had been  led to believe — and with different partners. When they sought obtain copies of the agreement and sales contracts, as well as promised audit reports on their investment, Manafort and Gates did not respond to their requests. Deripaska’s lawyers then sought and obtained the appointment of court-appointed liquidators to investigate what happened to his money."

Trump hits 50 percent in national GOP poll for the first time,2826,"While Republican frontrunner Donald Trump still needs more than 300 delegates to reach 1,237 — the magic number needed to secure the GOP presidential nomination — he has finally reached a key milestone in his bid for the White House: support from half of the country’s likely Republican voters.According to a new NBC News/SurveyMonkey national tracking poll released Tuesday, 50 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they support the real estate mogul’s candidacy, compared to the 26 percent who support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and the 17 percent who are backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Trump’s double-digit lead over his GOP rivals is one reason Cruz and Kasich banded together this week in an effort to block the brash billionaire from winning the GOP nomination.Excluding independents, Trump now enjoys 49 percent support among Republican voters, up six points from last week, when the same poll was conducted prior to his resounding primary victory in New York.Trump nearly reached 50 percent in a CNN/ORC poll conducted in February, when he led Florida Sen. Marco Rubio by 33 points (49 percent to 16 percent) among Republican and Republican-leaning voters.Crossing the 50 percent threshold is important for Trump, who has hovered in mid-to-high-40 percent range in recent weeks — leading some to speculate that the White House hopeful had hit his ceiling with GOP voters.In a statement blasting the Cruz-Kasich pact Monday, Trump complained that he “would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates” running against him.On the Democratic side, frontrunner Hillary Clinton is ahead of Bernie Sanders nationally, but her lead has narrowed to just 2 points, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Monday shows.According to the survey, the former secretary of state has the support of 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, while Sanders has the support of 48 percent. In the same poll conducted last month, Clinton held a 9-point lead over the Vermont senator.Heading into Tuesday’s primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, recent polls show Trump and Clinton leading in all five states — where wins would put each candidate closer to clinching their respective party’s nomination.Slideshow: Candidates vie for 5 Northeastern states >>>"
Hillary Clinton: Half of my Cabinet will be women,8925,"Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton says that if she’s elected president, at least half of her Cabinet will be women.During a town hall hosted by MSNBC on Monday night, host Rachel Maddow asked Clinton whether she would match a campaign promise Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made good on earlier this year.“He promised when he took office that he would have a Cabinet that was 50 percent women, and then he did it,” Maddow said. “Would you make that same pledge?”“Well, I am going to have a Cabinet that looks like America,” the former secretary of state replied. “And 50 percent of America is women, right?”President Obama’s Cabinet, of which Clinton was once a member, currently comprises seven women and 16 men.Last week, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said that the former first lady’s shortlist of potential running mates will include women, quickly leading to speculation that Clinton will consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a popular progressive, for an all-female ticket.“We’ll start with a broad list and then begin to narrow it,” Podesta told the Boston Globe. “But there is no question that there will be women on that list.”Hillary Clinton smiles during a campaign stop at City Hall in Philadelphia on Monday. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)The Democratic party’s would-be challenger, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, responded on Fox News, accusing Clinton of pandering to female voters.“The only thing she’s got is the woman card,” Trump said. “I’d love to see a woman president, but she’s the wrong person. She’s a disaster.”Earlier in Monday’s town hall, Clinton was asked by a member of the audience what it means to her to be a feminist.“Well, I believe I am a feminist because I believe that women deserve the same rights as men in every aspect of our economy and our society, here at home and around the world,” Clinton said to applause. “You know, I’ve devoted a lot of my public life to advocating for women’s rights being human rights, and making the case that we have to do everything we can, through laws, regulations, culture, to change the still-existing stereotypes that hold women back.”She pointed to equal pay, saying it’s not “just a woman’s issue” but something that affects everyone.“If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter who is working and they are not being treated fairly, the whole family suffers,” Clinton said."
"After Tuesday, will Bernie Sanders’ tone pave way for concession?",1964,"Sen. Bernie Sanders at a campaign stop on April 21 in Scranton, Pa. (Photo: Jake Danna Stevens/The Times & Tribune via AP) Polls suggest that Sen. Bernie Sanders is poised to lose Maryland and Pennsylvania in key races Tuesday, raising questions about whether the progressive candidate — who continues to raise millions of dollars from his passionate supporters — will adopt a more unifying tone as his chances for the Democratic nomination fade.During last week’s New York primary, Sanders sounded a defiant note as he lost the delegate-rich state, fiercely criticizing rival Hillary Clinton in an hourlong speech at Penn State University. He blasted her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs as his supporters booed heartily. Sanders’ campaign manager appeared on MSNBC later that night, arguing that the campaign would fight all the way to July’s convention to woo superdelegates away from Clinton.By Sunday, however, Sanders was already striking a more conciliatory note. On “Meet the Press,” he acknowledged that his campaign’s path to victory was “narrow,” but said he still hoped to win. Though he stressed he was not writing his campaign’s “obituary” yet, he spoke of his run in the reflective manner of someone who sees that the party could be nearing an end. Sanders said he’s “proud” he brought “millions of young people” into the political process.SLIDESHOW – Candidates vie for 5 Northeastern states >>>But when pressed about whether he would encourage his young supporters to back Clinton, the senator said the primary responsibility will be on Clinton, not him, to convince people that “she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people.”As Sanders shifts his campaign away from a fight for the nomination and toward a fight for his supporters’ more progressive values to have a louder voice within the Democratic Party, it remains to be seen whether and how quickly his rhetoric against Clinton will soften. Howard Wolfson, a Democratic strategist who helped run Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2008, said that Sanders finds himself in a similar position as Clinton did in the spring of 2008. She had won many states but found it mathematically unlikely that she would clinch the nomination. Still, it was hard to let go.“It’s a little bit of a head-heart dichotomy. You are able to coldly look at the math and draw conclusions from it, but your heart tells you that you should keep going,” Wolfson said. Candidates are also surrounded by their most fervent supporters, even when they’re losing. “I remember in 2008 when Hillary Clinton would be on a rope line in the spring, she would have women come up to her and say, ‘Don’t you dare drop out.’”At some point after the Clinton camp’s realization that the nomination was unlikely, the tone of the Clinton-Obama primary — which was in many ways more antagonistic than this current contest — cooled off. The détente came from both the Obama and Clinton camps.“Let me tell you, it does take two to tango,” Wolfson said. “It’s important for the front-running campaign, the likely victor, to also recognize that the next real goal is about unity rather than continued acrimony. To their credit, I think the Obama campaign began to ease off the gas a little, as well.”Clinton has already seemed to back off some of her camp’s attacks on Sanders. At her victory speech in New York, she said that more unites Sanders and Clinton supporters than divides them. But she’s going to have to do more than that to bring Sanders’ supporters into the fold. The contest between the two was at its most acrimonious just a week ago in New York, and the pair spent most of the Democratic debate in Brooklyn earlier this month shouting at each other.Hillary Clinton at her primary night party last Tuesday in New York City. (Photo: Louise Wateridge/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)“It’s up to Clinton at this point to extend an olive branch,” said Matt Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College.The Clinton campaign also has to be careful not to be seen as shoving Sanders off the stage, in order to respect the campaign that he’s run and the support he’s amassed.“She has a self-interest in giving him space, giving him time, letting him make his case,” said Bob Shrum, a veteran political consultant and professor at the University of Southern California.Clinton knows she will be stronger with Sanders’ and his supporters’ backing, and can try to win that by meaningfully including the senator in the Democratic convention in July. She faces the daunting task of wooing Sanders without allowing him to hijack her message or drive her too far to the left before the general election.The two may end up horse-trading. Clinton could offer key Democratic platform positions like a $15 minimum wage or a ban on fracking — as well as a prime speaking slot at the convention — in exchange for his support.“The trick is to do that without ceding control of the party’s message to Sanders,” Dickinson said.Shrum said he has “no doubt” that Sanders will stay in the contest until California’s primary on June 7, and will likely continue to run through July’s convention, even as his chances dim.Shrum was Ted Kennedy’s speechwriter during the 1980 convention, when the senator refused to raise his arm in celebration when then-President Jimmy Carter clinched the nomination over him. Shrum says this convention will be nothing like that poisonous atmosphere.“[Sanders] is probably going to go to the convention and he’ll speak at the convention, but it’s not going to be antagonistic,” Shrum said. “He’s run a spectacular campaign that no one predicted. So if it’s going to end, the other side needs to let it end in a way that gives him respect and recognition and even more so gives that respect and recognition to his supporters.”"
Cruz-Kasich pact highlights the importance of Indiana,748,"Donald Trump is calling it “pathetic,” “corrupt” and an “act of desperation”— but a state-by-state alliance between Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich aimed at denying the real estate mogul the Republican presidential nomination highlights the increasing importance of Indiana, a state that could be make-or-break for the #NeverTrump movement.When Republican voters head to the polls Tuesday in five states — Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut and Rhode Island — Trump is expected to notch significant wins in each. So much so that the campaigns are already looking past Tuesday to May 3, when Indiana Republicans head to the polls in one of the last true battleground states.Of the 15 states that remain on the GOP primary calendar, Indiana offers more delegates than any other except Pennsylvania and California. Thirty delegates will go to the candidate who wins the statewide vote, while the remaining 27 will be allotted to the winners of the state’s nine congressional districts.In a campaign where every single delegate increasingly counts, a win in Indiana would make Trump’s quest to reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination nearly unstoppable. But a Trump loss there would make it harder for him to sew up a first-ballot nomination. That’s why Kasich, in a deal announced late Sunday night, agreed to stop campaigning in the Hoosier State, hoping that a win there by Cruz would improve the chances of a contested nomination at the convention in Cleveland this July. In exchange, Cruz is standing down his operations in Oregon and New Mexico, where Kasich is believed stronger.But it’s not clear this maneuver will work.In theory, Cruz would have a good shot at winning Indiana, a heavily Republican state where social conservatives, led by Gov. Mike Pence, dominate the party’s voting electorate. But the few polls conducted in the state have found Trump narrowly leading Cruz ahead of next week’s primary. A CBS News/YouGov survey released last week found Trump leading Cruz by five points, 40 percent to 35 percent, a result that was within the poll’s six-point margin of error.So Cruz has shifted his focus away from the five Northeastern states voting Tuesday to concentrate almost entirely on Indiana, where he has been campaigning since last Thursday. He’s expected to crisscross the state in coming days and is also making a big push to win Pence’s endorsement.A former congressman, Pence has seen his approval rating plummet over the past year, in part because of his support of a controversial religious freedom bill that many viewed as discriminatory against gays and lesbians. But the governor still remains wildly popular among Republicans, especially social conservatives — the voters Cruz desperately needs to turn out for him next Tuesday.But Trump isn’t ceding any ground in the state. Last week, in a rare move for a candidate known to brag about Republicans coming to him rather than the other way around, Trump kicked off his first visit to Indiana with a trip to the governor’s mansion, where he met with Pence and personally asked for his endorsement. The meeting was brokered by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former head of the Republican Governors Association who since dropping out of the race himself and endorsing Trump has been using his party connections to woo support for the GOP frontrunner.Slideshow: Primary day in 5 Northeastern states >>>Photo illustration: Yahoo News, photos: APAt the same time, the Trump campaign has opened three offices around the state, where staff and volunteers have set up phone banks and are going door-to-door looking for votes. A flier handed out at a Trump rally in Indianapolis last Wednesday promised volunteers a free “Make America Great Again” hat for knocking on 50 doors or making 500 phone calls.The inducement is apparently working. The following day, Trump’s campaign office in Carmel, just north of Indianapolis, was packed in the middle of the day — as volunteers clutching call sheets for prospective voters sat at tables and paced the sidewalk outside making phone calls to get out the vote for Trump.While a campaign spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about Trump’s organization in Indiana, including how many staff are on the payroll, the campaign’s efforts seem more active than in other early states, including Iowa, where Trump invested little money or effort in a ground operation.On Monday, the Cruz campaign reportedly reserved nearly $1 million of television ad time in Indiana, as the Texas senator goes all in on a state that may be his last chance to stop Trump. And his campaign is hoping that with Kasich out the way, Cruz can top Trump in a head-to-head matchup. But it’s not likely to be that simple.There’s no guarantee that Kasich’s supporters will automatically turn to Cruz. And although Kasich has said he’s not going to campaign in Indiana, he pointedly told reporters during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Wednesday that he’s not asking his supporters to vote for another candidate.“I’ve never told them not to vote for me — they should vote for me,” the Ohio governor said, insisting the deal was more about “resources” and “not a big deal.”Meanwhile, Trump, who has spent the past week trashing the nomination process as “corrupt” and “rigged,” added the Cruz-Kasich alliance to his list of evidence of how he alleges party insiders are trying to steal the nomination from him — more evidence, he claimed, of his own dominance.“It shows that they are just getting killed,” Trump told supporters at a Rhode Island rally on Monday. “It shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are.”"

Transgender rights: Where 2016 candidates stand on bathroom bills,1744,"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz speaks at a middle school in Terre Haute, Ind., on Sunday. (Photo: Darron Cummings/AP)The rights of transgender people have become an unlikely talking point in the 2016 presidential election.Controversy erupted last month after North Carolina passed House Bill 2 (HB2) requiring people to only use restrooms that correspond with their biological sex, as stated on their birth certificate. Civil liberties groups, public servants, corporations and entertainers were among the many parties wading into the discussion.Supporters of so-called bathroom bills generally argue that girls and women would be put in harm’s way if transgender women were allowed to use women’s restrooms. Critics, on the other hand, say bathroom bills legalize discrimination against an already vulnerable community.All of the remaining candidates from the two major U.S. parties have sounded off about transgender rights since Gov. Pat McCrory signed HB2 on March 23.Cruz: Keep men out of girls’ roomsRepublican candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz supports the North Carolina law, and has said that it would prevent men from using the same bathrooms as little girls.“Let me make this real, real simple for our folks in the media who find this conversation very confusing,” Cruz said at a campaign stop in Indiana on Sunday. “If Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can’t go to the girl’s bathroom.”On Friday, the Cruz campaign released a video that asks if a grown man “pretending to be a woman” should be allowed to use the same restroom as someone’s daughter or wife.“It’s PC nonsense that’s destroying America,” a video caption reads. “Donald Trump won’t take on the PC police. He’s one of them.”Trump: Not a problemCruz focused some of his criticisms of the opposition to the law on businessman Donald Trump, in part because of the Republican frontrunner’s take on the issue.On Thursday, Trump told NBC’s “Today” that former Olympian and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner — a high-profile transgender woman — would be able to use whichever bathroom she chooses if she visits Trump Tower.“There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate — there has been so little trouble,” he said to the morning show. “North Carolina, what they’re going through with all the business that is leaving and strife — and it’s on both sides — you leave it the way it is.”Trump said he opposes the creation of transgender-specific bathrooms, which he thinks would be “discriminatory in a certain way,” and an unnecessary expense for U.S. businesses.“Leave it the way it is,” he added.Ohio Gov. John Kasich at a town hall meeting in Rockville, Md., on Monday. (Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters)Kasich: I wouldn’t have signed HB2On Sunday, GOP candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that he likely would not have signed the polarizing North Carolina law.Kasich told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that religious institutions should be protected to “live out their deeply held religious purposes,” but that the issue of religious liberty becomes contentious beyond that.“Obviously I don’t want to force people to violate their deeply held religious convictions, but we’d have to see what that’s all about. I wouldn’t have signed that law from everything I know. I haven’t studied it,” he said on the program.According to Kasich, Ohio is not facing this issue, and everyone needs to take a deep breath and respect one another.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on “The View,” April 8. (Photo: Lorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC via Getty Images)Sanders: Bathroom bills are discriminatoryVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders condemned HB2 as a clear-cut case of discrimination shortly after it was signed.“It’s time to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This law has no place in America,” he tweeted.On April 8, during an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” Sanders said that if elected, he would do everything in his power to overturn the law.Sanders said the U.S. has come too far, and there has already been too much discrimination throughout the nation’s history.“I hope we remember what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us,” he said on “The View.” “You judge people on their character, not on the color of their skin. And I would add to that: not on their gender or sexual orientation.”Sanders’ campaign site includes a section titled “Fighting for LGBT Equality,” which says it is unacceptable that people can still legally deny transgender men and women housing.It also outlines several steps Sanders says he would take on behalf of LGBT rights if he were elected president. One is that he would require police departments to adopt policies aimed at “fairer interactions with transgender people.”Clinton: Bathroom bills are discriminatoryDemocratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Clinton wrote a tweet similar to Sanders’ on the same day.“LGBT people should be protected from discrimination under the law — period,” Clinton tweeted. It was signed “-H” to indicate that she wrote the tweet herself.Clinton’s official campaign website includes a section on protecting transgender rights and ending discrimination against the transgender community, presenting the candidate as a firm LGBT ally.“Hillary believes no one should be held back from fully participating in our society because of their gender identity,” it reads in part.According to the campaign, Clinton made it possible for transgender Americans to have their preferred gender reflected on their passports; as president, she intends to direct government to collect better data on crime victims and improve reporting of hate crimes to protect transgender people from violence.

Donald Trump mocks John Kasich’s ‘disgusting’ eating habits at raucous rally,1118,"Donald Trump’s plan to act more presidential appears to have been put on hold.The Republican frontrunner blasted his opponents at rally in Rhode Island on Monday, unleashing a barrage of attacks in a speech that was like a greatest hits version of his most popular campaign insults.Trump tossed in a few new ones, too, like this critique of John Kasich’s table manners.“If you look at Kasich … did you see him?” a fiery Trump asked the crowd in Warwick, R.I., where he was interrupted several times by protesters in an atmosphere that seemed more carnival-like than usual. “He has the news conference all the time when he’s eating. I’ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.”But Trump wasn’t done riffing on the Ohio governor’s eating habits.“I’m always telling my young son, Barron, and I’m always telling my kids — all of them — I say, ‘Children, small, little bites,’” the real estate mogul explained. “This guy takes a pancake and he’s shoving it in his mouth — it’s disgusting. Do you want that for your president? I don’t think so! I don’t think so! Honestly, it’s disgusting.”Kasich enjoys a slice at Gino’s Pizzeria while campaigning in New York City last month.

Leave Tom Brady alone.”"
Candidates vie for 5 Northeastern states,4,"Presidential frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump seek to deliver knockout blows to their rivals in Tuesday’s five high-stakes primaries, with pressure mounting to wrap up the nomination races and pivot toward the general election battle.Clinton, aiming to become the nation’s first female commander in chief, faces a resilient liberal senator, Bernie Sanders, whose grassroots campaign to highlight income inequality has mobilized millions of young voters.But the former secretary of state is poised to extend her delegate lead Tuesday, when Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island host their primaries.A canopy of drama hangs over the Republican race, where the math points to a contested convention.That means Trump will have to defy the odds with particularly strong showings through the remainder of the statewide contests if he is to win the nomination outright before the party’s delegates gather in Cleveland in July to pick their nominee.Snatching most of the Republican delegates at stake April 26 would propel him that much closer to reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to nail down the nomination.His campaign is increasingly on notice, however, that the provocative celebrity billionaire would need to surpass that number and not merely outperform rivals Sen.

Bernie Sanders surrogate Rosario Dawson under fire again — this time for invoking Monica Lewinsky,2006,"For at least the fourth time in his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders was asked over the weekend to address controversial comments made by one of his surrogates on the campaign trail. And for the second time this month, the surrogate causing the controversy was actress Rosario Dawson.At a rally in Delaware on Saturday, Dawson invoked Monica Lewinsky’s name while saying that Sanders’ female supporters have been subjected to bullying by backers of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.“We are literally under attack — not just for supporting the other candidate,” Dawson said. “I’m with Monica Lewinsky on this … bullying is bad.”On CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, Sanders was asked whether bringing up Lewinsky was appropriate.“I have no idea in what context Rosario was talking about her,” Sanders said. “But I would hope that all of our people focus on the real issues facing working people and the massive level of income and wealth inequality that we have.”At a rally in New York City this month, Dawson told the crowd that Clinton was “about to be interviewed” by the FBI about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.“Shame on Hillary,” Dawson said. “Sorry, hold on, let me watch my tone … yes, she is under FBI investigation. That isn’t being promoted very much, but she is about to be interviewed in a little bit.” The Clinton campaign responded, saying no such interview was imminent.Yet Sanders — who has repeatedly refused to attack Clinton on the email issue — declined to condemn Dawson.“We have dozens of surrogates, and Rosario is doing a great job for us,” he said on CNN. “We have many, many surrogates who say many, many things. Many of these surrogates do not agree with everything I say. And I do not agree with every approach and everything that they say. And that’s the simple reality.“She will say what she wants to say,” Sanders added. “That is not what I will be focusing on.”Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who endorsed his Vermont counterpart earlier this month, said Dawson’s use of Lewinsky’s name in her attack on Clinton was out of line.“This is individuals going off track on their own,” Merkley said on CNN Monday. “It’s not helpful to the campaign, and it’s certainly not in keeping with what Bernie wants to see.”When it comes to Sanders surrogates speaking out of turn, though, Dawson is not alone.At a rally in Atlanta in February, rapper Killer Mike, one of Sanders’ most visible supporters, stirred controversy while relaying a conversation he had with an activist who told him, “A uterus doesn’t qualify you to be president of the United States.”In that case, Sanders defended the rapper.“What Mike said, essentially, is that … people should not be voting for candidates based on their gender, but based on what they believe. I think that makes sense,” Sanders told reporters. “I don’t go around … no one has ever heard me say, ‘Hey, guys, let’s stand together, vote for a man.’ I would never do that, never have.”But the Vermont senator quickly condemned a comment made by one of his health care surrogates who referred to “corporate Democratic whores” during a massive at a rally in New York City.“Medicare for all will never happen if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry instead of us,” Paul Song said before Sanders spoke at the April 13 event that drew some 27,000 to Washington Square Park.“Dr. Song’s comment was inappropriate and insensitive,” Sanders tweeted the next morning. “There’s no room for language like that in our political discourse.”"

Here’s what you need to know today.  Are you ready for (yet another) Super Tuesday?First there was the actual Super Tuesday on March 1 — you know, when all those Southern states weighed in. Then there was Super Tuesday II, or Super Duper Tuesday, on March 15: Florida, Missouri, Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio.Now there’s Super Tuesday III, which we here at Unconventional have decided to call “Super Acela Tuesday.” Why? Because Amtrak’s high-speed train passes through every state with a primary tomorrow: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Also, tomorrow is a Tuesday, and if more than one state votes on a Tuesday, journalists are pretty much required to describe it as “super.”All told, there are 384 Democratic delegates and 172 Republican delegates at stake on Super Acela Tuesday — the biggest single-day haul on either side until California, New Jersey and several other states cast the final votes of the 2016 primary season on June 7.So we can expect Tuesday’s results to have a big impact on both the Democratic and Republican primary contests, right?Well, yes and no.Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are likely to sweep Super Acela Tuesday. But while Trump’s victory may be more lopsided, Clinton’s will be more consequential.Let’s tackle Trump and his Republican rivals first. Three of Tuesday’s states have multiple recent polls: Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Trump is clobbering Ted Cruz and John Kasich in all three:  by nearly 20 percentage points, on average, in Pennsylvania;  by more than 20 percentage points, on average, in Connecticut; and by nearly 15 percentage points, on average, in Maryland. The other two Super Acela Tuesday states have only been polled once in recent days, but again, Trump appears to be way ahead, with  a 13-point lead in the Rhode Island poll  and  a staggering 37-point lead in the Delaware poll. Given the delegate-allocation rules in each of these states — winner-take-all in Delaware, proportional in Rhode Island and hybrid elsewhere — Trump is likely to wake up Wednesday with 100 or so new delegates in his column. That’s more than he won in last week’s much-ballyhooed New York primary.So why won’t this be a huge deal? Two reasons.The first is that no matter how well Trump performs Tuesday, he won’t be netting nearly as many delegates as he normally would — and it’s all Pennsylvania’s fault. The Keystone State holds what’s known as a loophole primary: It sends 71 delegates to the Republican National Convention, but only 17 of them are bound to vote for the statewide primary winner; the other 54 (three from each congressional district) can vote for whomever they want. In the other GOP loophole states — Illinois and West Virginia — unpledged delegate candidates are listed on the ballot alongside their preferred candidate, so at least voters have some idea which presidential wannabe they’re helping with their votes. That’s not the case in Pennsylvania. The delegate ballot is just a list of names, many of them unrecognizable.As the New York Times’ Nate Cohn  has written, “In a standard proportional allocation, Mr. Trump would probably be on track to win at least 40 of [Pennsylvania’s] delegates. In a winner-take-most system, like Indiana’s or California’s, Mr. Trump would be favored to win at least 60 delegates.” Given the narrowness of Trump’s path to 1,237, 60 delegates would be a big boost. Instead, Trump will likely win a mere 17 pledged delegates from Pennsylvania on Tuesday, which won’t be enough to alter his trajectory.The second reason that Super Acela Tuesday won’t be as super for Trump as one might expect is that the likely results are already baked into the projections about how the rest of the Republican primary calendar will play out. To clinch the nomination before the convention in Cleveland, Trump needs 1,237 delegates. Right now he has 845. He will have about 950 on Wednesday. At that point, he will need to win 58 percent of the remaining pledged delegates to make himself the nominee. Polling and demographics suggest that Trump will pick up another several dozen in West Virginia, New Jersey and New Mexico, and that Cruz will do the same in Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota.None of this is particularly mysterious, nor would any of it be decisive. The only remaining tossups — and the only remaining states that could either stop Trump or propel him to victory — are Indiana (May 3) and California (June 7). They both award a lot of delegates: 57 in the former, 172 in the latter. And no one has any idea how they will shake out.That’s why, for Trump, Super Acela Tuesday won’t be about delegate math. It will be about momentum. Can six straight eastern landslides help lift the tinsel-haired mogul to victory the following week in Indiana, where Cruz may currently be favored to win? Will they make Trump look “inevitable”? And will they bring Republicans any closer to accepting him as their nominee?As for Clinton, she won’t clinch her party’s nomination on Tuesday, either. But the delegate math will matter more for her than it will for Trump.Clinton’s Super Acela Tuesday polling margins aren’t quite as sizable as Trump’s. But she leads across the board: by an  average of 7.5 points in Connecticut, an  average of 14.8 points in Pennsylvania, an  average of 21.7 points in Maryland, and by 7 points and 9 points in the latest Delaware and Rhode Island polls, respectively. Three of Tuesday’s states — Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania — have significant non-white populations, which will help Clinton. And except for Rhode Island none allow independents to vote, which is a problem for Bernie Sanders (who may be  receiving as much as 40 percent of his votes from non-Democrats).If the polling numbers hold, Clinton is likely to emerge from Tuesday’s contests — which, like the rest of the Democratic primaries, award their delegates proportionally — with an additional 200 or more delegates to her name. Including superdelegates — among whom Clinton currently leads Sanders 513 to 38,  according to the Associated Press  — such a result would give Clinton 90 percent of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.Ninety percent isn’t 100 percent, of course. But it’s close. More importantly, it leaves Sanders with almost no plausible path to the nomination. In recent weeks, the Sanders team has been arguing that with a strong showing in the final run of primaries, their man could overtake Clinton in the pledged delegate count and thereby convince a decisive number of superdelegates to switch sides and support him.But to do that after a Super Acela Tuesday in which Clinton wins 200 additional delegates — a conservative estimate — Sanders would have to win more than 63 percent of the pledged delegates at stake in the remaining primaries. He has won about 45 percent of the pledged delegates awarded to date.There is a reason, in other words, why Sanders’ chief strategist, Tad Devine, is telling reporters that the campaign will “reassess” after Tuesday’s results come rolling in.“Next week is a big week,” Devine told the Associated Press last Tuesday. “We’ll see how we do there, and then we’ll be able to sit back and assess where we are.”You can bet that Hillary Clinton is very much looking forward to this assessment._____Sen. Ted Cruz shakes hands with Gov. John Kasich at a CNN debate in Coral Gables, Fla., in March. (Photo: Wilfredo Lee/AP)The first time John Weaver, the chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, approached Jeff Roe, his counterpart for the Ted Cruz campaign, about divvying up the remaining primary states in an effort to stop Donald Trump from clinching the Republican nomination before the convention, Roe wasn’t interested. It was right after the March 10 GOP debate in Miami, and Roe couldn’t stand the thought of ceding a bunch of high-profile contests in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to a candidate with far fewer delegates than Cruz.Now Roe seems to have changed his mind.Late Sunday night, Roe released a statement saying that going forward, the Cruz campaign would “focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico.”Minutes later, Weaver confirmed the new arrangement with a statement of his own: Kasich, he wrote, had agreed to “give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.”Just when you thought the 2016 Republican primary couldn’t get any weirder.For Kasich, the new cease-fire with Cruz represents an opportunity to augment his meager delegate tally before Cleveland — perhaps by enough to pass Marco Rubio, who still leads the Ohio governor by 24 delegates even though he suspended his campaign on March 15. Together, New Mexico and Oregon award 52 delegates (albeit proportionally).For Cruz, the détente will give him a clear shot at winning Indiana, one of the two remaining tossups on the calendar. (The other is California.) After a big loss in New York — and likely losses Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware and Maryland — Cruz will need a victory to slow Trump’s momentum. Indiana is his best chance. Trump leads in  the latest polls by an average of 6.3 percentage points, but Cruz  has several structural advantages  in the Hoosier State. If some of Kasich’s support — which is concentrated in the Indianapolis suburbs and currently stands at nearly 20 percent, on average — transfers over to Cruz, the Texan could come out on top.But the point of Sunday’s sudden pact is not the good it could do for Cruz or Kasich, but to hurt Trump. Neither Cruz nor Kasich can win the nomination outright at this point; their only hope is to cobble together a delegate majority after the first ballot in Cleveland. And the only way to ensure a second ballot in Cleveland is by preventing Trump from reaching 1,237 during the primaries. By maximizing their respective vote totals in Indiana, New Mexico and Oregon, what Cruz and Kasich are really trying to do is hold down Trump’s vote.The question now is whether their alliance will backfire. For weeks Trump has been arguing that the GOP “establishment” has “rigged” the system to keep him from winning. There is evidence that this argument has been working.He continued to make the same case Sunday night.“It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination,” Trump said in a statement. “Everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged. When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters, (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system. This horrible act of desperation, from two campaigns who have totally failed, makes me even more determined, for the good of the Republican Party and our country, to prevail!”Before, Trump was wrong. Nothing was rigged; he was simply railing against the rules. But now Trump’s rivals are, in fact, conspiring against him. The chances of a contested convention may depend on how his supporters react._____Following Bernie Sanders’ loss to Hillary Clinton in the New York primary last week, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, vowed that the Vermont senator would take his fight to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July.But now the candidate seems to be having second thoughts.

Heading into that year’s convention, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was trailing Ohio Sen. Robert A. Taft by as many as 100 delegates, though neither had a majority. But then Eisenhower’s team accused Taft’s people of stealing delegate votes in Southern states by illegally blocking Eisenhower delegates and packing delegations with their supporters. Even though Taft denied the charge, the convention voted 658-548 in favor of a rules amendment — called “Fair Play” by Team Ike — that wound up unseating numerous pro-Taft delegates. Eisenhower won the nomination as a result._____For the latest data, make sure to check the Yahoo News  delegate scorecard and primary calendar  ."
Obama ramps up special forces mission in Syria against Islamic State,183,"By Roberta Rampton HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - President Barack Obama announced on Monday the biggest expansion of U.S. ground troops in Syria since the civil war there began, saying he would dispatch 250 special forces soldiers to help local militia to build on successes against Islamic State. The new deployment increases U.S. forces in Syria six-fold to about 300. While the total U.S. ground force is still small by comparison to other American deployments, defense experts said it could help shift the momentum in Syria by giving more Syrian fighters on the ground access to U.S. close air support. Obama said the move followed victories that clawed back territory from Islamic State. “Given the success, I’ve approved the deployment of up to 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria, including special forces, to keep up this momentum,” Obama said in a speech in the German city of Hanover, the last stop on a foreign tour that has taken him to Saudi Arabia and Britain. “They’re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces as they continue to drive ISIL back,” he added, using an acronym for Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh. The U.S. military has led an air campaign against Islamic State since 2014 in both Iraq and Syria, but the campaign’s effectiveness in Syria has been limited by a lack of allies on the ground in a country where a complex, multi-sided civil war has raged for five years. Russia launched its own air campaign in Syria last year, which has been more effective because it is closely coordinated with the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is Moscow’s ally but a foe of the United States. CLOSE AIR SUPPORT Washington’s main allies on the ground have been a Kurdish force known as the YPG, who wrested control of much of the Turkish-Syrian border from Islamic State. However, the alliance has been constrained because U.S. ally Turkey is deeply hostile to the YPG. “Presumably these are going to assist our Kurdish YPG friends to widen and deepen their offensive against IS in northeastern Syria,” Tim Ripley, defense analyst and writer for IHS Janes Defence Weekly magazine, said of the extra special forces. “The more people you have, the more militia groups can have close air support that makes them more effective so they can advance in more areas,” Ripley said. But Washington would still have to take a political decision to help the Kurds despite Turkish objections. Kurdish advances have largely stopped since February, with Turkey opposed to the Kurds taking more territory. “The real question has to be: are they going to let the Kurdish YPG forces actually go and attack and capture some territory? This is something the Americans have not been happy about because when the YPG forces attack and capture territory, it tends to anger the president of Turkey,“ Ripley said. The Syria Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed coalition set up in October to unite the Kurdish YPG and some Arab allies, welcomed Obama’s announcement but still wanted more help. ""Any support they offer is positive but we hope there will be greater support,” SDF spokesman Talal Silo said. “So far we have been supplied only with ammunition, and we were hoping to be supplied with military hardware.” The HNC umbrella opposition, which represents groups opposed to Assad but not the Kurds, also welcomed U.S. forces helping rid Syria of the Islamic State “scourge”, but said Washington should do more to fight against Assad. “Syria will not be free of terrorism until we see the end of the Assad regime’s reign of terror. We need help in freeing our country from Assad as well as from Daesh,” spokesman Salem al-Meslet said in a statement. If the Kurds are given the green light to advance with American air support, the main short-term objective could be sealing off the last stretch of the border that is not held by the Kurds or the government, west of the Euphrates river. That would deny Islamic State access to the outside world, but would infuriate Turkey which regards the border as the main access route for other Sunni Muslim rebel groups it supports against Assad, and for aid to civilians in rebel areas. THE RACE FOR RAQQA U.S. special forces teams providing close air support could ultimately help the Kurds advance on Raqqa, Islamic State’s main Syrian stronghold and de facto capital. “This places them in another quandary. Do they coordinate their attack on Raqqa with the Syrian army and the Russian air force, who are … advancing on Raqqa? … The question is who’s going to get there first,” Ripley said. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel sitting in the audience, Obama also urged Europe and NATO allies to do more in the fight against Islamic State. The group controls the cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria and a swathe of territory in between, and has proven a potent threat abroad, claiming responsibility for major attacks in Paris in November and Brussels in March. “Even as European countries make important contributions against ISIL, Europe, including NATO, can still do more,” Obama said ahead of talks with Merkel and the leaders of Britain, France and Italy. European countries have mostly contributed only small numbers of aircraft to the U.S.-led mission targeting Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. Obama pledged to wind down wars in the Middle East when he was first elected in 2008. But in the latter part of his presidency he has found it necessary to keep troops in Afghanistan, return them to Iraq and send them to Syria, where the five-year civil war has killed at least 250,000 people. In Iraq, Islamic State has been forced back since December when it lost Ramadi, capital of the western province of Anbar. In Syria, jihadist fighters have been pushed from the city of Palmyra by Russian-backed Syrian government forces. TALKS IN MELTDOWN, TRUCE IN TATTERS But Washington’s lack of allies on the ground has meant its role in Syria has been circumscribed. The sudden entry of Moscow into the conflict last year tipped the balance of power in favor of Assad against a range of rebel groups supported by Turkey, other Arab states and the West including Washington. Washington and Moscow sponsored a ceasefire between most of the main warring parties since February, which allowed the first peace talks involving Assad’s government and many of his foes to begin last month. However, those talks appear close to collapse, with the main opposition delegation having suspended its participation last week, and the ceasefire is largely in tatters. Islamic State is excluded from the ceasefire. Fighting has increased in recent days near Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city, now split between rebel and government zones. A monitoring group said 60 people had been killed there in three days of intense fighting, including civilians killed by rebel shelling and government air strikes. The Syrian government’s negotiator at the Geneva talks said a bomb hit a hospital near a Shi'ite shrine near Damascus, killing many innocent people and proving the government’s enemies were terrorists.

Trump accuses Cruz and Kasich of ‘collusion’,1247,"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump blasted Ted Cruz and John Kasich after his GOP rivals announced they are joining forces in a last-ditch effort to stop the blustery billionaire from securing the party’s presidential nomination — accusing the Texas senator and Ohio governor of “collusion” against him.“Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive,” Trump said in a lengthy statement posted to his campaign website. “They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are.”Trump called the alliance “sad”:Trump argued that he would have won the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination had there not been for such a crowded field of candidates in the GOP race:Late Sunday, the Cruz and Kasich campaigns released statements within minutes of each other announcing their plan to divide the upcoming Republican contests, with the Texas senator focusing on Indiana and the Ohio governor setting his sights on Oregon and New Mexico.Ted Cruz and John Kasich shake hands as Donald Trump looks on following a debate in Miami in March. (Photo: Rhona Wise/AFP)“To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana,” Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said in a statement, “and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico.”Trump took to Twitter to trash his rivals.“Wow, just announced that Lyin’ Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination,” he tweeted. “DESPERATION!”Trump continued: “Lyin’ Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Shows how weak and desperate Lyin’ Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can’t stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.”Speaking to reporters at a diner in Philadelphia Monday, Kasich said that despite the pact with Cruz, he isn’t going to dissuade his supporters in Indiana from voting for him.“I’ve never told them not to vote for me,” Kasich said at a diner in Philadelphia. “They ought to vote for me.”"
Obama says new US troops in Syria will be essential,64,"HANNOVER, Germany (AP) – President Barack Obama on Monday announced the deployment of up to 250 U.S. military personnel to Syria, mostly special operations forces, to assist local troops trying to dislodge Islamic State extremists. He called the move essential to keeping up momentum against the group.The deployment will bring the number of personnel to roughly 300, up from about 50 special operations forces currently in Syria.Obama revealed his decision a week after Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that more than 200 U.S. troops soon will be headed to Iraq, where local forces are also battling Islamic State militants who control areas of that country. He said none of the new forces heading to Syria would participate in direct combat.“They’re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces,” Obama said during a speech in Germany that capped a weeklong trip that also took him to Saudi Arabia and Great Britain.IS was a focus of private talks with his counterparts in all three stops.Senior U.S. officials have been touting the success of the existing U.S. forces in Syria, including their effectiveness in assisting local forces and generating critical intelligence that helps the U.S.-led coalition against IS target insurgents.“We want to accelerate that progress,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser.Obama said U.S.- European collaboration must extend to the threat posed by IS. As he announced deeper U.S. involvement, he urged Europe to step up, too.Before returning to Washington, Obama huddled with the leaders of Great Britain, Germany, France and Italy. He said ahead of the meeting that he planned to ask those nations to step up their training and airstrike contributions to the campaign against IS and to provide more economic aid to rebuild parts of Iraq recaptured from IS.“Europe and NATO can still do more,” he said. “We need to do everything in our power to stop them.”Obama discussed his troop decision briefly during a broader speech on U.S.-European relations and the importance to the world of continued European unity. Obama urged Europe’s leaders to pay attention to income inequality, which he said creates wedges among populations, and other issues including education for young people and equal pay for equal work for women.“If we do not solve these problems, we start seeing those who would try to exploit these fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way,” Obama said. He decried an “us-versus-them” mentality that breeds animosity toward immigrants, Muslims and others.“This is a defining moment and what happens on this continent has consequences for people around the globe,” Obama said. “If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic, free-market Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question the progress that’s been made over the last several decades, then we can’t expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will continue.”The president’s appeal for Europe to stick together came days after he made a forceful argument while in London against Great Britain exiting the European Union. The possibility of Britain leaving the EU in a June referendum, along with the regional terrorist threat and the Syria refugee crisis, has raised questions about the strength of European unity.Libya was also expected to be a topic of discussion at Obama’s high-level meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo.Obama discussed Libya during separate talks with Cameron and Merkel. He recently said failure to plan for the fallout after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was toppled in 2011 was his biggest mistake.Libya since has descended into chaos and become a base for IS. But Obama has said he has no plans to send in ground troops and prefers to support a newly installed unity government in the North African country.Obama has said he remains opposed to large-scale U.S. military intervention in either Iraq or Syria. But he has incrementally deepened U.S. involvement in both countries, opening him up to charges of mission creep.Carter last week announced the deployment of an additional 217 U.S. troops to Iraq, bringing the total to just over 4,000 in the first major increase in nearly a year. Eight Apache helicopters were also being sent to Iraq for the first time to help fight IS.Both moves were cast as helping Iraqi forces as they prepare to retake the key northern city of Mosul.___Superville reported from Aerzen, Germany.

"Cruz, Kasich strategies align with goal of beating Trump",1973,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — In an extraordinary move, Donald Trump’s Republican rivals late Sunday announced plans to coordinate primary strategies in upcoming states to deprive the GOP front-runner of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.Ted Cruz and John Kasich issued near-simultaneous statements outlining an agreement that may be unprecedented in modern American politics. The Kasich campaign will give Cruz “a clear path in Indiana.” In return, the Cruz campaign will “clear the path” for Kasich in Oregon and New Mexico.The arrangement does not address the five Northeastern states set to vote on Tuesday, where Trump is expected to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead. Kasich and Cruz had already retreated to Indiana, which holds its primary on May 3. Yet the shift offers increasingly desperate Trump foes a glimmer of hope in their long and frustrating fight to halt the former reality television star’s unlikely rise.“Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,” Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said in a statement explaining the new plans. “Not only would Trump get blown out by Clinton or Sanders, but having him as our nominee would set the party back a generation.”Added Kasich’s chief strategist, John Weaver, “Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee.”The announcement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz’s team, which aggressively opposed coordinating anti-Trump efforts with Kasich as recently as late last week. And it only applies to Indiana, Oregon and New Mexico — three of the 15 states remaining on the Republican primary calendar.Yet the development underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman’s Republican foes: Time is running out to stop him.Trump responded on Twitter shortly before midnight: “Wow, just announced that Lyin’ Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!”The announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire leads in many polls. Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland, which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware.Speaking to several thousand people in an airplane hangar in Hagerstown, Maryland, Sunday evening, Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention.“I only care about the first. We’re not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth,” said Trump.As Kasich backs out of Indiana, Cruz promised to not compete in primary contests in Oregon on May 17 and New Mexico on June 7.“We will focus our time and resources in New Mexico and Oregon, both areas that are structurally similar to the Northeast politically, where Gov. Kasich is performing well,” Weaver said.As recently as three days ago Kasich’s campaign announced investments in Indiana, including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership team. His campaign on Sunday night canceled a town hall and gathering in Indianapolis scheduled to watch the results of Tuesday’s primaries.Like Cruz’s campaign, Kasich’s campaign encouraged allied super PACs and other outside groups to “honor the commitments.”In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly denounced the GOP’s presidential nominating system as “rigged.” That criticism is likely to intensify in the coming days.There was far less drama on the Democratic side Sunday.Underdog Bernie Sanders rallied thousands of voters in two New England states, seeking momentum even as he offered mixed signals on how hard he would push his differences with front-runner Hillary Clinton.The Vermont senator largely steered clear of Clinton at a Rhode Island park, but hours later ramped up his critique before more than 14,000 supporters in New Haven, Connecticut. Sanders reiterated his call for Clinton to release transcripts of lucrative Wall Street speeches she delivered after leaving the State Department in early 2013.“This campaign, unlike Secretary Clinton’s, has not raised $15 million from Wall Street and millions more from other special interests,” he said as the crowd booed at the mention of Clinton’s name.Clinton eyed victories in four or five of Tuesday’s contests, which would all but cripple Sanders’ White House bid.The former secretary of state went to two Philadelphia church services attended largely by African-Americans ahead of the primary in Pennsylvania, Tuesday’s top delegate prize. She declined to attack her Democratic rival by name in the morning appearance and a subsequent stop in Bridgeport, Connecticut, focusing on the GOP candidates.Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz downplayed tensions between Sanders and Clinton, whose rivalry has become increasingly nasty in recent weeks.“Regardless of the intensity of what’s played out here … we are going to be unified,” she declared.___Peoples reported from Washington.

Bernie Sanders: ‘We intend to take the fight all the way to California’ — but not necessarily the convention,3316,"Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally in Providence, R.I., on Sunday. (Photo: Steven Senne/AP)Following Bernie Sanders’ loss to Hillary Clinton in the New York primary last week, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, vowed that the Vermont senator would take his fight to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July.But on Sunday, Sanders would only look as far ahead as California’s Democratic primary on June 7.“We intend to take the fight all the way to California,” Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos,” “so people throughout this country have a right to determine who they want as president and what kind of agenda they want for the Democratic Party.”Sanders repeated the phrase when asked if he would support Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the fall, just as she supported Barack Obama in 2008.“We’re not giving this thing up,” the self-described democratic socialist said. “We’re going all the way to California. But if she is the nominee, I would hope that she puts together the strongest progressive agenda that says, ‘Yes, we’re going to stand with the working families in this country. We are prepared to take on the fossil fuel industry and the drug companies Wall Street and the billionaire class.’ And if she has a candidate for vice president who is prepared to carry that mantle, prepared to engage in that fight, I think that would be a very good thing for her campaign.”On NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Sanders focused on the present.“We are in this race. We are not writing our obituary. We’re in this race to California,” he said, before letting a tense change slip. “And we’re proud of the campaign we ran.”On CBS’ “Face The Nation,” Sanders said it wouldn’t be fair to the Golden State to drop out before it got to vote.“You can’t say to largest state in this country, ‘California, you can’t determine who the nominee will be or what the agenda will be,’” he said.On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sanders pointed to its 475 delegates as his “narrow path” to winning the Democratic nomination.“I’m not going to tell you that it’s easy,” Sanders said. “What polls seem to be showing is that many of the states yet to come — including California, our largest state — we have a real shot to win. And I think, also, there are a lot of delegates out there who are looking at the general matchup, and what they’re seeing in polls is that Bernie Sanders is running a lot stronger against Donald Trump than is Hillary Clinton, because we can appeal to a lot of independents and people, not just the Democrats.”“So, I think we do have a path to victory,” Sanders continued. “I think we have come a very, very long way in the last year, and we’re going to fight for every last vote until the California and the D.C. primary.”The Washington, D.C., primary is scheduled for June 14.In an interview with Yahoo News last week, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook predicted she’ll have the magic number of delegates needed to secure the nomination by that date.“I’m not concerned with the primary going until the end,” he said. “I think Hillary, by the end of the primary, by the time the states on June 7 and June 14 vote, it’ll be clear who the nominee is gonna be.”"
The Obamas in London for royal holiday... and a bit of business,701,"President Obama plunged into a whirlwind of socializing Friday that began over a birthday lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, and ended with a dinner hosted by the trio of young royals who represent the future of the British monarchy.Obama, accompanied by his wife, Michelle, arrived by helicopter on the verdant grounds of Windsor Castle, the sprawling, centuries-old royal residence just west of London where the queen celebrated her 90th birthday a day earlier.A series of royal engagements made up the centerpiece of Obama’s three-day valedictory trip to London, which was filled with multiple helicopter lifts and his lengthy motorcade winding its way through the city’s narrow streets.Obama broke up the royal holiday by stopping at 10 Downing St. for private talks with Prime Minister David Cameron about the so-called Islamic State, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, the global economy, Russia’s stance toward Ukraine and other issues.They also discussed Britain’s possible exit from the European Union, or Brexit, which Obama opposes, as well as the U.S. presidential campaign that will determine Obama’s successor. Obama capped the day with a trip to Kensington Palace, where he and the first lady were invited for dinner with Prince William, his wife, Kate, and his brother, Prince Harry. William is second in line to ascend to the throne after his father, Prince Charles.Obama on Saturday opened his last full day in London by taking in a performance cribbed from William Shakespeare’s Hamlet,  including portions of the prince of Denmark’s famous “To be or not to be” soliloquy.The performance was part of Obama’s tour of the Globe theater — his way of partaking in the widespread commemorations of the Bard on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death.Obama next stop was town hall-style event with young people.U.S. President Barack Obama implored young British people on Saturday not to pull back from the world, a day after sparking a row by bluntly telling Britain it should remain in the European Union to preserve its remaining global clout. Speaking to about 550 invited British young people at a “town hall” event on Saturday, Obama sought to pitch a more optimistic message to young Britons, who are considered to be more pro-European, if less active voters than their parents.

Correction: Campaign 2016 story,1210,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) — In a story April 21 about a presentation made by Donald Trump’s chief lieutenants at an RNC meeting in Florida, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Trump aide Paul Manafort said, “You’ll see a real different guy.” The correct quote is: “You’ll see a real different way.”A corrected version of the story is below:Trump team tells GOP he has been ‘projecting an image’Donald Trump’s chief lieutenants told skeptical Republican leaders Thursday the GOP front-runner has been “projecting an image” so far in the 2016 primary season and “the part that he’s been playing is now evolving”By STEVE PEOPLES and THOMAS BEAUMONTAssociated PressHOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump’s chief lieutenants told skeptical Republican leaders Thursday that the GOP front-runner has been “projecting an image” so far in the 2016 primary season and “the part that he’s been playing is now evolving” in a way that will improve his standing among general election voters.The message, delivered behind closed doors in a private briefing, is part of the campaign’s intensifying effort to convince party leaders Trump will moderate his tone in the coming months to help deliver big electoral gains this fall, despite his contentious ways.Even as his team pressed Trump’s case, he raised fresh concern among some conservatives by speaking against North Carolina’s “bathroom law,” which directs transgender people to use the bathroom that matches the sex on their birth certificates. Trump also came out against the federal government’s plan to replace President Andrew Jackson with the civil-rights figure Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.The developments came as the GOP’s messy fight for the White House spilled into a seaside resort in south Florida. While candidates in both parties fanned out across the country before important primary contests in the Northeast, Hollywood’s Diplomat Resort & Spa was transformed into a palm-treed political battleground.Trump’s newly hired senior aide, Paul Manafort, made the case to Republican National Committee members that Trump has two personalities: one in private and one onstage.“When he’s out on the stage, when he’s talking about the kinds of things he’s talking about on the stump, he’s projecting an image that’s for that purpose,” Manafort said in a private briefing.“You’ll start to see more depth of the person, the real person. You’ll see a real different way,” he said.The Associated Press obtained a recording of the closed-door exchange.“He gets it,” Manafort said of Trump’s need to moderate his personality. “The part that he’s been playing is evolving into the part that now you’ve been expecting, but he wasn’t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase. The negatives will come down. The image is going to change.”The message was welcomed by some party officials but criticized by others who suggested it raised doubts about his authenticity.“He’s trying to moderate. He’s getting better,” said Ben Carson, a Trump ally who was part of the GOP’s front-runner’s RNC outreach team.While Trump’s top advisers were promising Republican leaders that the GOP front-runner would moderate his message, the candidate was telling voters he wasn’t ready to act presidential.“I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” Trump said during a raucous rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Thursday that was frequently interrupted by protesters.“At some point, I’m going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored,” he said, predicting that the size of his crowds would dwindle if he dialed back his rhetoric.There was evidence of drama on the Democratic side as well.Prominent Southern Democrats urged Bernie Sanders to stop dismissing Hillary Clinton’s landslide primary wins across the South, where the front-runner’s popularity among non-whites has helped fuel her success.Sanders said the results in the South “distort reality” because they came from the country’s “most conservative region.”Don Fowler of South Carolina, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and other Clinton supporters told Sanders in a letter that “our national Democratic leaders” should “invest in our races and causes — to amplify our voices, not diminish them.”Yet as Clinton’s grasp on the Democratic nomination tightens, Trump’s overwhelming Republican delegate lead has done little to calm concerns from GOP leaders, gathered at the resort for the party’s meeting.As Trump continues to rail against “a rigged” nomination process, he sent Manafort and his newly hired political director, Rick Wiley, to help improve relationships with party officials at the meeting.“He might not win some of these blue states, but you can make the Democrats spend money and time,” Wiley said.Trump’s team also signaled to RNC members a fresh willingness to dip into the New York real estate mogul’s personal fortune to fund his presidential bid, in addition to helping the national committee raise money, a promise that comes just as Trump launches his first big television advertising campaign in a month.His campaign reserved about $2 million worth of air time in soon-to-vote Pennsylvania and Indiana, advertising tracker Kantar Media’s CMAG shows.“He’s willing to spend what is necessary to finish this out. That’s a big statement from him,” Manafort said in the briefing.Trump is increasingly optimistic about his chances in five states holding primary contests Tuesday: Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. He is now the only Republican candidate who can possibly collect the 1,237-delegate majority needed to claim the nomination before the party’s July convention.Chief rival Ted Cruz hopes Trump will fall short of a nomination-clinching delegate majority so that he can turn enough delegates to his side at the convention to give him the prize.The political posturing came as Trump sparked new criticism by addressing the debate over which bathrooms transgender people should use.Speaking at a town-hall event on NBC’s “Today” show Thursday, Trump said North Carolina’s bathroom law has caused unnecessary strife and transgender people should be able to choose which bathroom to use.“There have been very few complaints the way it is,” Trump said. “People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.”Cruz lashed out at Trump’s “support of grown men using women’s restrooms.” The Texas senator called Trump’s position “a reckless policy that will endanger our loved ones.”Trump also said the plan to swap Jackson for Tubman on the $20 bill is an act of “pure political correctness.”___Associated Press writers Alan Fram in Hollywood, Jill Colvin in New York, Julie Bykowicz in Washington, Julie Pace in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Errin Haines Whack in Philadelphia contributed to this report."
Unconventional #5: Inside Trump’s plan to clinch the nomination in California (and more!),104,"Unconventional is Yahoo News’ complete guide to what could be the craziest presidential convention — or conventions — in decades. Here’s what you need to know today. “If Mr. Trump does not have 1,237 delegates when he comes to California, he will have them when California is done voting,” predicts Tim Clark, Trump’s newly minted California political director.That’s a bold prediction. Some of the smartest political analysts in the country have taken a look at the Republican calendar, done the math, and concluded that Donald Trump is  likely to fall short of the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination — even after California, the last and largest of the primaries.But Clark isn’t worried. In fact, he’s downright confident. Or at least that’s how he sounded when Unconventional asked if he really wanted to predict, on the record, that California would make Trump the nominee.“If Mr. Trump doesn’t have the nomination by the time he comes to California,” Clark reiterated, “we will deliver the delegates he needs to put him over the top.”The last time the Golden State really mattered in a presidential nominating contest was 1984. But this year, as the state that will likely determine whether or not Trump hits the magic 1,237-delegate mark before the convention in Cleveland, it is poised to play a pivotal and potentially decisive role.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump throws a baseball cap from the stage aboard the USS Iowa battleship, in Los Angeles, September 2015. (Photo: Kevork Djansezian/AP)In Unconventional #1, we spoke to Tim Clark’s counterpart on the Cruz campaign — a former state GOP chairman named Mike Schroeder — about Cruz’s plan to prevent Trump from clinching in California.Schroeder cited three advantages for Cruz: 1) the state’s closed primary system (conservatives tend to prefer Cruz; independents tend to prefer Trump), 2) the fact that it’s winner-take-all by congressional district (which helps the candidate with the best ground game), and 3) the pick-your-own delegates requirement (names are due next month; Clark was just hired by Trump last week).As Dan Schnur, a former spokesman for Republicans Pete Wilson and John McCain who currently runs the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, puts it, “the Cruz folks have been at this for a year. Give Tim Clark a year and he’ll do very well.”Clark, of course, doesn’t have a year. The California primary is on June 7. But he does have a plan. Here are excerpts from our conversation:Unconventional: The Cruz campaign has a big head start on you. How do you expect to compete? Tim Clark: The California primary is about winning votes and winning the state. I’ve been involved in eight or nine statewide California Republican primaries over 22 years. With that comes a lot of knowledge about how to apply resources. That’s something you develop over time, by being on the battlefield. That’s where the difference is between the Trump campaign and the Cruz campaign. The Cruz campaign is very well-versed on insider politics — working with activists and delegates, planning conventions. The Trump campaign is very well-versed at winning statewide elections.Does Trump have any organization in California?I’m just five days on the job. I took one night off so I could watch Steph Curry get his 73rd game. But what I’ve found is that Trump activists have been organizing all over the state. I’m getting contacted by people that have been out holding rallies and just getting ready to go. The Trump volunteer network has been growing organically for over a year. That’s going to be a tremendous help to us. It’s not like I have to go recruit volunteers. I just have to find the ones who exist and give them the resources they need to leverage what they’re already doing. I mean, a gentleman walked in yesterday with his own literature printed for Donald Trump. They’ve been walking precincts for weeks. Some analysts have estimated that if Trump continues on his current trajectory, he will need to win 70 percent of the delegates from California to clinch the nomination. Is that accurate? There are varying estimates. There are several different models. But let me just say: Getting 70 percent of the delegates in California is not unrealistic.How do you plan to get there?Because California is winner-take-all by congressional district, you’ve got 53 individual races. A lot of those seats don’t have many Republican voters, and those will be key. Some will deliver 120,000 votes for the entire Republican field. Others will deliver 8,000 votes. Let’s say you can impact 500 votes in either of those two seats. Impacting 500 votes in a 120,000-vote field is barely a blip. But if you impact 500 votes among 8,000, all of a sudden you move the dial by perhaps 5 percent.I’m sure the Cruz people understand that strategy. We certainly understand that strategy. They have their analyses. We have our analyses. We’re going to be in neighborhoods where our guys turn the corner and see the Ted Cruz guys, and we’re going to double the Republican population in some of these seats with our volunteers. We know that’s coming. Then it all comes down to what the voters what. The Cruz people say the same thing. But they argue that they will be more organized than Trump on the ground. Do they have a point? Cruz has certainly run the better ground game so far. I don’t buy the premise that Cruz has the superior organization. I guarantee you that in our target seats, where we intend to make an impact, and where Cruz intends to make an impact, we will be just as organized, if not better organized, than they are. What about television and radio and mail? California is famous for its expensive air wars. But while the Trump campaign has signaled that it  will spend big on ads, the Cruz people told me that such a strategy would be a waste of money because you’d mostly be reaching Democrats.It really depends on where you can affect the vote. California has two of the most expensive media markets on the planet: Los Angeles and San Francisco. And that happens to be where the bulk of the congressional districts are, because it’s where the bulk of Californians live. So I think those are going to be tremendous paid media battlegrounds.We’re talking to strategists from all around the state. And for all of their races — assembly, state senate, Congress, county supervisor — they’re increasing their turnout models by 30, 40, 50 percent. With a bigger turnout, you have to ask, what’s the most efficient use of our paid media budget? When the turnout goes up, broadcast becomes more effective.LA and San Francisco are also where a lot of those “empty districts” are. TV could be an effective way to reach them.Exactly. And in those seats, the county clerks are reporting heavy re-registration movement toward the Republican Party. I can pretty much guarantee you: If you’re an independent — “declined to state,” as we put it in California — and you’re coming to the Republican Party right now, there’s a 99.9 percent chance you did that because you want to vote for Donald Trump. That’s changing the equation in some of the less-Republican seats, because every person who switches to the Republican Party in those districts has an outsize impact on the overall delegate count. The Cruz people told me that, because of your late start, you would have a hard time identifying 169 delegates and 169 alternates from all 53 districts in time to meet the upcoming deadlines. Care to respond? There’s no way. We’re locked down. Our prospect list has already been vetted and is approaching 500 names around the state. We’re at least three-deep in every district. There have been a couple of longtime seasoned political veterans in the state who were contacted a couple of months ago and asked to get the process started. We are far ahead of where we expected to be.You don’t sound worried. The  CBS poll with a 2,400-person sample just came out showing us up by 18 points. That’s approaching landslide territory. They had us at 49 percent and Cruz at 31. When you have that type of lead, that translates down into every one of the 53 seats.But   other polls have shown a much closer race. The 2,400 sample is the biggest sample I’ve seen, and that’s what you need in a state like this, where you’ve got 53 individual races. I feel very strongly that our state is going to break for Donald Trump in a substantial way.Do you worry that Trump’s immigration views will alienate California Republicans, who tend to be more moderate on immigration?Where he’s going to shine out here and where he’s absolutely going to roll up the vote is when it comes to leadership and jobs and the economy. Take Silicon Valley out of the mix, and California’s recovery is still lagging. In survey after survey, that’s No. 1. People are saying, “My economic situation is not improving.” And that’s Donald Trump’s message.So are you ready to campaign in places like Berkeley and Compton?It’s going to be an election unlike anything I’ve seen in my 22 years in politics._____Fresh off  Hillary Clinton’s victory over Bernie Sanders in the New York Democratic primary, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook predicts that she’ll soon have the magic number of delegates needed to secure the nomination — and doesn’t understand the  Sanders campaign’s vow to take its fight to the convention.“I don’t see a clear path for them, at this point,” Mook told Yahoo News’ Katie Couric on Tuesday night. “The numbers are pretty daunting.” Watch the rest of Mook’s comments, then drop me a line (@andrewromano) and let me know what you think: Does Sanders still have a shot at the nomination? _____Attendees eat lunch before hearing Florida Gov. Rick Scott speak at the Republican National Committee Spring Meeting, Thursday, April 21, 2016, in Hollywood, Fla. (Photo: Wilfredo Lee/AP)The nerdiest convention news of the week comes from Hollywood, Fla., where the Republican National Committee’s 168 members have been holed up for the last few days for their annual spring meeting. If you recall, Hollywood was  supposed to be the site of an Epic Clash over the rules governing this summer’s convention in Cleveland.So what happened? Well, nothing much.Let’s rewind for a second. On one side of the clash were Solomon Yue, an RNC member from Oregon, and Rules Committee Chairman Bruce Ash, both of whom were pushing the RNC to consider a proposal to replace the rules that have been used at Republican National Conventions for decades with Robert’s Rules of Order, which commonly guide civic and association meetings.On the other side were RNC Chair Reince Priebus and his allies, who wanted to scuttle the proposal. “I don’t think that it’s a good idea for us next week [or] before the convention to make serious rules changes or recommendations of changes,” Priebus said Sunday on CNN.Switching the rulebook could have meant the difference between a convention where the chairman can reopen the nomination to dark-horse candidates (which is possible under the current rules) and a convention where only current candidates — Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich — would likely be considered. It also would have given more power to the delegates themselves, and less to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is likely to serve as the convention’s presiding officer.But alas: Priebus & Co. prevailed.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus at the Republican National Committee Spring Meeting in Hollywood, Florida, April 21, 2016. (Photo: Joe Skipper/Reuters)The proposal did come up for a vote. It just didn’t come close to passing. There were two reasons for this. The first, as National Review’s Tim Alberta reported earlier this week, was substantive: “This idea has been offered ahead of past conventions, and it will be voted down this time for the same reason it was in the past: It would invite chaos on the convention floor.”“Under Robert’s Rules, if I stand up and the chairman recognizes me and I have the floor, I can ramble on forever about anything,” Curly Haugland, a North Dakota committeeman, told Alberta. “With a constituent group of 2,400 delegates, all of whom would have the right to ask for the floor — you just couldn’t possibly have that meeting under Robert’s Rules.”The second reason was political: the Rules committee doesn’t want to be seen as interfering in an ongoing process — and possibly tipping the scales in favor of one candidate or another.“We’re basically in the seventh inning of a ballgame, and I don’t think it’s right to change the rules of the game in the middle of the game,” argued Randy Evans, an RNC member from Georgia. “Any change we make would be viewed with a very large degree of cynicism.”The irony of all of this sturm und drang is that none of it really would’ve mattered anyway. Even had the 56-member Rules Committee endorsed Yue’s proposal, it would have only been a suggestion. Prior to Cleveland, a separate, 112-member Rules Committee would have had to approve the proposal, which then would have required the ratification of a majority of delegates on the convention floor.But hey: At least a bunch of political reporters scored a free trip to a beautiful Florida beach town. As Time’s Zeke Miller reported on Twitter, “There are more members of the press credentialed for the RNC meeting than there are RNC members.”_____Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop in Indianapolis.

(Photo: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images)Last weekend Donald Trump described the GOP primary system as “crooked” because, technically, there’s nothing stopping him from bribing unbound delegates before the convention in Cleveland.“It’s a corrupt and crooked system,” he said. “Look, nobody has better toys than I do. I can put [the delegates] in the best planes and bring them to the best resorts anywhere in the world. Doral, Mar-a-Lago. I can put them in the best places in the world.”Trump is right about one thing: There are no laws stopping him from wining and dining delegates. But he’s wrong about nobody having better toys than him — at least from a historical perspective. In 1976, when President Gerald Ford was battling Ronald Reagan for the GOP nomination, he had one tool of persuasion at his disposal that not even Mar-a-Lago can match: The White House.When the queen of England arrived for a sumptuous state dinner on July 7, 1976, the gentleman the president chose to seat next to her was Clarke Reed, chairman of the largest uncommitted delegation — Mississippi’s, with thirty convention votes.That was no accident. And guess who was in charge of Ford’s delegate strategy at the time? Paul Manafort — who just so happens to be Donald Trump’s top convention strategist._____For the latest data, make sure to check the Yahoo News  delegate scorecard and primary calendar."
A brief history of the Internet being suspicious of Ted Cruz’s identity,6853,"Is that you, Ted? (Screen shot via Reddit)Earlier this week, Reddit user missvh dropped a screen grab from “Maury” into an /r/pics thread with the simple caption, “A female guest on Maury that looks just like Ted Cruz.” The woman in the photo — who appeared on an episode titled “5 Men Tested … Will I Find My Daughter’s Father Today?” — did bear an uncanny resemblance to the Texas senator. For most people, the discovery would seem nothing more than a random, mildly entertaining coincidence. But to many users on the thread, it represented so much more than that.“That’s actually the Zodiac Killer dressed in drag,” user RandyIsMartian wrote in a heavily upvoted reply. A third user, MarryMeFrisbee, shot back, “…aka it’s just Ted Cruz?”Like most unsettling doppelgangers that emerge online, the observation went viral, inspiring numerous blog posts and sarcastic jokes on social media. Even “Maury” got in on the fun, posting the photo to Twitter with the caption, “Ted Cruz in drag on Maury? The Lie Detector Test determined-that was a LIE! Ted’s NOT that SEXY!”The look-alike incident was just the latest entry in a three-year-old conspiracy theory that mockingly questions whether the Republican presidential candidate is really who he claims to be — or whether he is actually the infamous 1960s serial murderer from northern California known as the Zodiac Killer.The hypothesis first originated out of nowhere in early 2013, when a Twitter account with the handle @RedPillAmerica posted a nonsensical joke that Cruz’s upcoming speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference that year would be titled “This Is the Zodiac Speaking.” It took more than a year for the joke to resurface on the social media platform in a completely unrelated context. “Ted Cruz’s Chilling Deathbed Confession: ‘I am the Zodiac Killer,’” user @Flash2844 tweeted, ending the post with the hashtag #TedCruzIsTheZodiacKiller.Screen shot via Know Your Meme.By the fall of 2015, the joke had picked up steam on Twitter, earning popularity from well-followed accounts like @vrunt and @lindzeta, who say that the sheer absurdity of the conspiracy theory encouraged them to publicize it further.“It was hilarious to me when it first came on my radar,” @lindzeta told Yahoo News in a direct message. “While it’s logically impossible, there’s definitely a part of it that seems like it could be true. It’s so outlandish, but Cruz seems to have this evil lunatic hiding underneath his whole public demeanor. It had just the right balance of possibility and impossibility.”In other words, it was perfect for the Internet, where preposterous ideas are often rewarded for the sake of being preposterous. (See: Boaty McBoatface.)“It’s simply funny to act as if this is some open secret about him,” @vrunt told Yahoo News in a direct message. “It’s this shared obvious lie and the only ticket to entry is to play along.”Jonathan Novak, a 22-year-old history undergraduate at Arizona State University, was one such willing participant. After seeing the joke on Twitter, he was inspired to start a Facebook group titled “Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer” in December 2015.“I thought it would be a good idea to start one in order to mobilize the masses and help expose a brutal murderer attempting to gain a stranglehold on what is left of American democracy,” Novak told Yahoo News with what sounded like a straight face. “Since then, the reaction has been about 80/20 split, with the majority of responses being millennials who love the joke and share it with their friends, and a small, vocal minority of older conservatives who don’t get it and like to point out that Cruz was not yet born when the murders occurred.”Through the page, Novak met Bo Quintana, a 16-year-old high school student from Milton, Ga., who also felt passionately about perpetuating the “theory.” The two promoted the page together as the joke simultaneously gained steam on Twitter. On Jan. 20, #zodiacted trended on the platform in the U.S. And by February, the meme had been picked up by publications like Esquire and the Daily Dot. That same month, Public Policy Polling released a national survey that showed nearly 40 percent of Florida voters thought Cruz might be the Zodiac Killer.A fan submission to the “Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer” Facebook page. (Photo via Facebook)With that uptick of attention, Novak and Quintana began receiving a healthy stream of Photoshopped images and homemade materials from fans of the group. Some came in the form of elaborate cakes decorated with “Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer” in frosting. One college student used the premise for an art project, for which he made an elaborately produced five-minute whiteboard video that connects Cruz’s odd behavior to that of the Zodiac Killer. A few high schoolers have even used the joke in signs to ask their dates to prom. “Toby, it’d be KILLER if you’d CRUZ to PROM with me,” read one poster board adorned with cryptographic symbols and the candidate’s face. Just this week, the group surpassed 26,000 likes on Facebook.A Ted Cruz as Zodiac Killer prom-posal. (Photo via Facebook)“The most intense submission was probably this incredible edit of the David Fincher movie ‘Zodiac’ with Ted Cruz’s ‘Green Eggs and Ham’ anti-Obamacare filibuster speech imposed on it,” Novak said.He and Quintana have taken to selling their own “Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer” stickers and T-shirts, but they say they won’t quit until one of two things happen.“The first one is that he would address it and deny that he was the Zodiac Killer, because there’s nothing more ridiculous to me than a legitimate presidential candidate that people vote for denying that he was a person he could never be in the first place,” Quintana said. “Our second goal was to be bought out by BuzzFeed for like two grand or something. But that didn’t happen. So we’re going with our guns and keeping with it.”(The two are at least gratified to know that Google appears to have altered the autocomplete when searching the phrase “Is Ted Cruz…,” meaning the senator’s campaign is attempting to combat the meme.)Since the meme has gained traction, it has also splintered into bit of a doppelganger-hunting sport. In early March,  a Facebook post by Michael Boulerice  pointed out that Cruz bore an uncanny resemblance to the lead singer of a Christian heavy metal band named Stryper. It spread quickly online, earning more than 55,000 shares and 3,800 comments. That opened the floodgates for other comparisons, which include (but are not limited to) Grandpa Munster, Kevin Malone from “The Office,” Duke University basketball player Grayson Allen, Mrs. Doubtfire and — most recently — the woman on “Maury.”Photo via FacebookBut the meme’s original purveyors aren’t buying it.“All of those are false, and they simply distract us from the truth,” Novak said. “The only other identity Ted Cruz plausibly has held besides being the infamous Zodiac Killer, terrorizer of San Francisco, is the lead singer of the Christian metal band Stryper. The only thing nearly as sinister as perpetrating such monstrosities as the Zodiac killings is the infliction of auditory torture via skintight yellow-and-black onesies and awful Christian hair metal staples like ‘To Hell With the Devil.’”"
'Happy Birthday' rings out as Queen Elizabeth turns 90,1042,"Windsor (United Kingdom) (AFP) - Well-wishers sang ""Happy Birthday"" to a smiling Queen Elizabeth II as she turned 90 on Thursday, celebrating the milestone by lighting a beacon and greeting cheering crowds in the streets.The sovereign, who has been on the throne since 1952 and steered Britain through the decline of its empire, wore a lime green outfit and matching hat to accept presents, cards and flowers from the crowd in Windsor.The thousands of well-wishers spontaneously broke into song, some singing ""Happy Birthday, dear Queenie"".The queen's eldest son and heir Prince Charles, 67, said ""Mummy"" was held in ""love and affection"" by the people she serves, as she lit a beacon outside Windsor Castle, west of London.The sovereign, who last year overtook her great-great-grandmother queen Victoria to become Britain's longest-serving monarch, later attended a lavish dinner hosted by Charles.More than 30 royals were among the 70-plus guests at the private black tie event.In a speech in parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain was ""uniquely blessed"" to have her, calling Queen Elizabeth a ""rock of strength"".Opposition socialist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a rare republican in public life, added that, whatever ""different views"" people have about the monarchy, most believe the queen ""has overwhelming support"".Beacons were set ablaze across Britain and the Commonwealth that Queen Elizabeth symbolically heads, with Charles leading well-wishers in three cheers as she lit the first.""Your Majesty, Mummy, I find it very hard to believe you've reached your 90th year and I suddenly realised the other day that I've known you since you were 22 years old,"" he said.The Prince of Wales said the beacon represented ""the love and affection in which you are held throughout this country and the Commonwealth"".He wished her ""the most special and happiest of birthdays on this occasion.

She said it was a lovely day.""In a tweet, the monarch said: ""I send my best wishes to those who are celebrating their 90th birthday. On this shared occasion, I send my warm congratulations to you.""To mark the royal birthday, there were also military gun salutes around the country and crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace.She was also presented with a three-tiered orange drizzle cake baked by Nadiya Hussain, winner of television cookery show ""The Great British Bake Off"".Royal officials released new pictures of the queen taken by US celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz.They were shot at Windsor Castle, where the monarch will on Friday host US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.In one photograph, the queen is pictured with four of her beloved dogs, while in another, she is surrounded by some of her youngest descendants, including all five of her great-grandchildren.While still active, the head of state has scaled back her duties in recent years as Charles and his 33-year-old eldest son Prince William take a more prominent role.- Embodiment of British identity -The royals remain popular but some question what will happen when the queen -- who is in good health, enjoying regular rides on her favourite pony and walking her corgi dogs -- reaches the end of her life.In an editorial, The Times newspaper praised her as ""a symbol of continuity and the best embodiment we have of a complex national identity"".But it warned the monarchy ""will not long retain its popularity"" if Charles, who often writes to ministers petitioning about issues close to his heart like the environment, is seen to breach the constitutional convention of neutrality as king.The royal family is currently in a strong position. Some 68 percent of Britons think the monarchy is good for Britain, according to a YouGov survey last year.However, it has not always been on as sure a footing under Queen Elizabeth as it seems to be now.It went through what the monarch described as an ""annus horribilis"" or horrible year in 1992 as her children's marriages collapsed, and its popularity plunged after Diana died in a Paris car crash in 1997 and the queen was accused of reacting coldly.Advisors subsequently steered the royals towards a more modern image."
Clinton campaign suggests possibility of an all-female ticket,1871,"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton celebrate at her New York primary campaign headquarters on Tuesday. (Photo: Kathy Willens/Associated Press) Hillary Clinton’s potential election as the first female president of the United States would be historic — but why stop there?In an interview with the Boston Globe Thursday, campaign chairman John Podesta said “there is no question that there will be women” on Clinton’s list of potential running mates should she win the Democratic nomination.Clinton, Podesta said, is looking “for the best person to make the case to the American people.”While Podesta didn’t name any names, his comments have already prompted pundits to make their shortlists of women who could hypothetically join Clinton on an all-female ticket.As the Globe noted, one of the first people who comes to mind is Elizabeth Warren, the liberal senator from Massachusetts who many believe could help Clinton wrangle reluctant supporters of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders.Other names that have been floated include Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo and Janet Napolitano, who served as the Democratic governor of Arizona before becoming the first female Homeland Security secretary in 2009. The Globe’s James Pindell suggested Clinton could even stray from the conventional choices and tap a political outsider like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. But, then again, he wrote, “that could prompt questions about her running mate’s preparedness and experience — neutralizing that issue somewhat if she wants to criticize Donald Trump for the same.” Back in January, Clinton told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that a female running mate was “absolutely not” out of the question, but Podesta’s recent comment seems to be the first indicator that an all-female ticket could realistically be on the horizon. "
Obama in Saudi Arabia for Persian Gulf Summit,69,"President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. and its Gulf partners should wait to see whether Iraq can resolve its political crisis before committing more financial aid, arguing that the paralysis is impeding U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State group and reconstruct the war-torn country.Obama’s warning appeared intended to put pressure on Iraqi leaders to put internal disputes aside so that a stable government can form. Yet it also reflected the limits of what Obama was able to achieve during a brief trip to Saudi Arabia. After meetings with officials from six Persian Gulf countries, he left with little to announce by way of new commitments the U.S. had requested.“Right now in Baghdad, there’s some big challenges,” Obama said. “Until that’s settled, I think it’s important for us to make sure that any additional stabilization dollars that we put in are going to be effectively spent.” (AP)Find more news-related photo galleries on the Yahoo News Photo Tumblr!"
Donald Trump: Caitlyn Jenner can use any bathroom in Trump Tower she wants,5272,"If Caitlyn Jenner walked into Trump Tower and asked to use the bathroom, Donald Trump says he would be fine with her using any one she chooses.During a town hall hosted by NBC’s “Today” on Thursday, the Republican frontrunner weighed in on North Carolina’s new law requiring transgender people like Jenner to use restrooms that match their sex at birth rather than their gender identity — saying the legislation was unnecessary.“There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate — there has been so little trouble,” Trump said. “North Carolina, what they’re going through with all the business that is leaving and strife — and it’s on both sides — you leave it the way it is.”Since North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed the controversial bill into law last month, the state has lost millions of dollars in revenue in a backlash led by businesses, including PayPal Holdings and Deutsche Bank, and major touring acts like Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam.Trump said he’s also against the related push to create new, non-gender-specific restrooms, though he may not have entirely understood the concept.“There is a big move to create new bathrooms, you know … for transgender,” he said. “I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is.”Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also weighed in on the transgender issue on Thursday, saying he supported the North Carolina law.“We have gone off the deep end. This is absurd,” Cruz told Glenn Beck. “The idea that grown men would be allowed to be alone in a bathroom with little girls — you don’t need to be a behavioral psychologist to realize bad things can happen.”Caitlyn Jenner and Donald Trump. (Photos: Getty Images)Cruz continued: “ESPN fired Curt Schilling for making the rather obvious point that we shouldn’t allow grown adult men strangers alone in a bathroom with little girls.”The senator then slammed Trump’s take on Twitter.On “Today,” the billionaire real estate mogul was also asked about the U.S. Treasury’s decision to replace President Andrew Jackson with black abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman on the face of the $20 bill.“Well, Andrew Jackson had a great history, and I think it’s really rough when you take somebody off the bill,” Trump said. “Andrew Jackson had a history of tremendous success for the country.”The former “Celebrity Apprentice” star said that if it were up to him, he’d leave Jackson on the $20 bill and create new currency to honor Tubman — something Ben Carson, who has endorsed Trump’s presidential bid, first suggested.“I think Harriet Tubman is fantastic,” Trump said. “I would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if we could come up with maybe another denomination. Maybe we do the $2 bill or we do another bill. I don’t like seeing it. Yes, I think it is pure political correctness.”"
Queen Elizabeth’s 90th Birthday,2396,"Britain celebrated the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday with tributes to a popular monarch who has steered it through the decline of empire and a wave of scandals to the Internet age.The sovereign, who has been on the throne since 1953, emerged from Windsor Castle dressed in a lime green outfit and matching hat to accept presents and flowers from hundreds of well-wishers.Prime Minister David Cameron hailed her as “a rock of strength for our nation,” and her son and heir, Prince Charles, marked the occasion by reading Shakespeare in a special broadcast on BBC radio.Later on, the monarch, who last year overtook her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria to become Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, will host a family dinner to celebrate.She will also light a beacon, the first in a chain of a thousand that will be lit around the country and the world, symbolizing the length of her life and her reign.

Trump and the nomination Matrix,938,"Donald Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after he won the New York state primary. (Photo: John Moore/Getty Images)Any reporter who has ever spent time on a presidential campaign has heard the perennial rant about “process stories.” That’s when the candidate tells you that really he is desperate to illuminate in numbing and nuanced detail his plan to reverse the decline of American manufacturing (which consists of about 500 words of boilerplate blather on his website), but all we in the media ever ask about is how he intends to win, so he can’t.(Of course, if you ask him to sit down and talk about the manufacturing plan, his aides will say no, because how can they trust that you’re really going to ask him about the manufacturing plan and not about, you know, the process? Alas, this is their predicament.)At this late stage in the 2016 races, however, process seems to be the only thing some candidates actually do want to talk about. The system itself has now become the burning issue of the campaign.Bernie Sanders rails against a rigged system supported by “superdelegates” and “closed” primaries. And of course Donald Trump has now launched a full-on assault against the rules of the Republican nominating process, which he seems determined not to grasp. Trump’s son Donald Jr.  weighed in  earlier this week, when he told Sean Hannity, “I feel like we’re living in communist China.”This would be a cogent observation, except that, A, in communist China you go to prison for publicly excoriating the integrity of party leaders, and B, Junior’s dad once praised the strong Chinese response to the “riot” in Tiananmen Square, so I guess brutal repression is fine so long as it’s being used only to shut down and punish people who don’t agree with you.All that aside, these indictments of the process are bound to reverberate well beyond the conventions, and I’d bet you a lot of money that we are, in fact, going to see some big changes in the way we choose our presidents.Just don’t be surprised if it’s not the parties who actually change it.There’s a strange “Matrix”-type thing happening in Republican politics right now (and, to a lesser extent, among Democrats), where voters are suddenly waking up in their little gooey cocoons and realizing that they don’t actually nominate their candidates as they’ve always been led to believe they do.As I wrote a few weeks ago, and as the Democratic expert Elaine Kamarck explained to my colleague Jon Ward here, the nominees in both parties have always been chosen by a select group of delegates. For most of our history, those delegates were responsive to voters only to the extent that they cared about fielding a candidate with some demonstrated appeal.In other words, the parties held a few primaries so they could better judge their nominees — not so they could empower voters to choose them.By the time the tumultuous, violent cycle of 1968 had ended, though, it was clear that a system entirely dominated by local party bosses couldn’t hold without some major retooling. That’s because the traditional nominating process — particularly in the Democratic Party — was colliding head on with the momentum of powerful social movements.A new generation of activists demanded a system that included more women and minorities and gave more power to the voters themselves. After much reflection and argument, the modern primary system was born, and Republicans quickly emulated it.What this has meant, in practical terms, is that nominees of both parties are chosen, almost without exception, by a majority of primary voters.In truth, though, the same generation of party activists who reformed the system in the late 1960s have spent most of the past four decades trying — quietly and bureaucratically — to consolidate their own power against popular uprisings.Thus did Democratic leaders invent the all-powerful superdelegates after the 1980 election, to keep another insurgent like Ted Kennedy at bay. (Among those who enacted that plan, by the way, was a guy named Tad Devine, who’s now the chief strategist for Sanders. Ruminate on that.)Just four years ago, Republican leaders came up with an arbitrary eight-state rule, which said no one who hadn’t won eight primaries could be nominated. The rule was intended to thwart Ron Paul; now, of course, party elders are talking about rescinding it so they can nominate someone who isn’t Trump or Ted Cruz.The 2016 campaign seems now to have become something very close to 1968 — a moment when the nominating process suddenly feels absurdly out of step with larger shifts in the society. In this case, the irreconcilable conflict isn’t about social justice, as it was then, but about the rise of transparency and the toppling of big institutions.Voters in the age of eBay and WebMD, who increasingly decline to affiliate with either party and who tend to believe they could do heart surgery themselves if directed to the right webpage, aren’t inclined to tolerate an arcane process that gives them only a limited say in the outcome. The illusion of democratization, perpetuated by both parties for 40 years, has been exposed.Writing in The Hill newspaper this week, Mark Penn, the onetime grand strategist of the Clinton world, offered some suggestions for party reform. Penn urged the parties to adopt open primaries, e-voting and a rotating sequence of primaries to reflect different parts of the country — all solid ideas, if you ask me.Except for one small problem: A party apparatus exists for a reason, and that reason is to consolidate power, not give it away. You might as well ask the oil industry to build an electric car, or tell movie theaters they should be handing out iPads.Opening up the process in such radical ways might be great for the democracy, but it would be significantly less great for the state chairmen or committeemen who would have to enact those reforms at the expense of their own control.No, reform is more likely to come not from within, but from without. If Trump loses the Republican nomination despite piling up a plurality of votes (or even if he wins only to find that the party establishment undercuts his campaign at every turn), the next generation of Trumps — and they’re coming, believe me — will be tempted to bypass the nominating process altogether.Here’s what I think it will look like: Aspiring, novice candidates who are rich or famous or both will do it the way Ross Perot did it in 1992, or the way Michael Bloomberg threatened to do it this year. They will take on the arcane, state-by-state ballot system and run as independents. And sooner than later, one of them will win.Like Trump, most of these outsider candidates will be populist reflections of their moment, channelers and manipulators of emotion, exploiters of a vacuum in the market. They will deploy in passion and fury what they could never have amassed in organizational muscle.Will our politics get more democratic after 2016? Yes.Nobody said it would get better."
Harriet Tubman to be first African-American on U.S. currency,2865,"By Megan CassellaWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anti-slavery crusader Harriet Tubman will become the first African-American on the face of U.S. paper currency, and the first woman in more than a century, when she replaces former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.The U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday that Tubman, who was born into slavery in the early 1820s and went on to help hundreds of slaves escape, would take the center spot on the bill, while Jackson, a slave owner, would move to the back.Introduced alongside a slew of changes to the $5 and $10 notes as well, the redesign gives the Treasury “a chance to open the aperture to reflect more of America’s history,” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.A new $10 bill will add images of five female leaders of the women’s suffrage movement, including Sojourner Truth and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, to the back, while keeping founding father Alexander Hamilton on the front.The reverse of a new $5 note will show former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., officials said. Former President Abraham Lincoln will remain on the front.Lew said the designs should be unveiled by 2020 and go into circulation “as quickly as possible,” although he declined to say when. He said the $10 bill was scheduled to go out first, citing security needs.The long-awaited decision to replace the seventh president of the United States with Tubman followed months of outreach by the Treasury regarding which woman should be featured on a bill.The debate began when the Treasury announced plans in June to feature a woman on the $10 note, prompted partly by a young girl’s letter to President Barack Obama that criticized the lack of women on U.S. currency and a social media campaign last year called “Women on 20s.”A MUSICALHamilton’s growing celebrity status, due largely to a Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway musical about his life, “Hamilton,” created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, propelled an effort to keep the first U.S. Treasury secretary on the $10 note and to replace Jackson on the $20 bill instead.Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812’s Battle of New Orleans, was president from 1829-1837. But he has been criticized for his treatment of American Indians and ownership of slaves.After considering hundreds of candidates, Lew said Tubman was chosen for her leadership and work helping others.“It’s the essential story of American democracy about how one person who grew up in slavery, never had the benefit of learning how to read or write, could change the course of history,” he said.Tubman grew up working on a Maryland plantation and escaped in her late 20s. She returned to the South to help hundreds of black slaves to freedom and worked as a Union spy during the Civil War. She died in 1913.Women have not been depicted on U.S. bills since Martha Washington, who was on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Pocahontas, who was in a group picture on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.On coins, Sacagawea, a Native American who assisted the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is featured on the gold dollar, and suffragist Susan B. Anthony is on the silver dollar. Deaf-blind author and activist Helen Keller is on the back of the Alabama quarter.Tubman became the top-trending hashtag on Twitter shortly after the news broke on Wednesday, with more than 100,000 tweets and mentions online.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who is campaigning to become the first female U.S. president, praised Tubman as “a woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter” on Twitter and said she could not think of a better choice.Some Twitter users applauded Treasury’s decision to keep Hamilton on the $10 bill.Actress Mara Wilson (@MaraWritesStuff) tweeted at Miranda, the “Hamilton” creator, saying: “@Lin_Manuel First you win a Pulitzer, now you’re affecting US currency. Get some rest!“(Reporting by Megan Cassella; Additional reporting by Timothy Ahmann in Washington and Gina Cherelus and Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Peter Cooney)"
"The new, old Trump brings back ‘Lyin’ Ted’",678,"INDIANAPOLIS — Donald Trump apparently isn’t finished with “Lyin’ Ted.”The real estate mogul and Republican frontrunner revived his favorite nickname for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at a rally here, repeatedly using it to trash his rival for his alleged close ties to special interests and for his efforts to outmaneuver Trump in the race for delegates to the party convention.“I’m millions of votes ahead of ‘Lyin’ Ted,’” Trump boasted, slamming the Texas senator for trying to exploit a “rigged” and “corrupt” delegate system.Trump’s taunts came just a day after he revealed a new, more restrained side at his New York primary victory event Tuesday night, referring to his rival as “Senator Cruz” and offering a more disciplined message. The GOP frontrunner has frequently bragged that he can be “presidential” when he chooses,  and his change of tone spurred speculation that he was embracing a more general-election friendly message on the advice of new campaign aides, including convention manager Paul Manafort.Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Indianapolis, April 20, 2016. (Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) But in his first campaign appearance here ahead of Indiana’s May 3 primary, Trump was back to his rambunctious self, whipping up the crowd with his taunts of Cruz and the Republican Party establishment. He also verbally tangled with protesters, who repeatedly interrupted his hour-long remarks here.“Get ’em out of here,” Trump growled repeatedly, as supporters cheered wildly.But there were none of the violent encounters between Trump’s supporters and the hecklers that marked some of his earlier rallies. When one man left quietly with police, Trump made fun of him from the stage.“These protesters aren’t very tough around here,” Trump said. “That’s good.”"
"Tubman bumps Jackson, Hamilton survives, Internet reacts",2176,"Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew announced Wednesday that abolitionist Harriet Tubman will replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Last June, the Treasury Department announced the $10 bill would be redesigned “to feature the face of a woman who contributed to the development of democracy in the United States,” and launched an accompanying social media campaign, #TheNew10, to ask the public for suggestions. However, the massive success of Broadway’s “Hamilton” — a musical about Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, current occupier of the $10 bill — combined with some lobbying by its creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, looks like it will keep the nation’s first Treasury Secretary on the ten. Jackson, the seventh president, was responsible for the forced relocation of Native Americans and preferred gold and silver to paper money.Here are a few of our favorite reactions to today’s news:"
Obama in Saudi Arabia for Persian Gulf Summit,35,"Reassuring an anxious ally, President Barack Obama sat down Wednesday for a meeting with King Salman as he opened a trip to Saudi Arabia shadowed by the kingdom’s deep opposition to his Iran nuclear deal and skepticism about his approach to Syria.Obama, during a roughly 24-hour stay in the Saudi capital, planned to attend a Persian Gulf summit focused on regional stability, Iran and counterterrorism – including the fight against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida.Under crystal chandeliers, King Salman greeted Obama in a grand foyer at Erga Palace, where the two walked slowly to a reception room as the small of incense wafted. The two offered polite smiles as they sat down side by side for pictures at the start of their two-hour private meeting.“The American people send their greetings and we are very grateful for your hospitality, not just for this meeting but for hosting the GCC-U.S. summit that’s taking place tomorrow,” Obama said, referring to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council summit.

"Kelly Ripa 'Refusing' to Return to Live!, Source Says as Departing Michael Strahan Tells Absent Co-Host 'I Love You' on Air",11,"Kelly Ripa was absent from Wednesday’s episode of Live! With Kelly and Michael – and a source tells PEOPLE it’s unclear when she’ll return. “Kelly told ABC she wasn’t coming in last night,” says the source. “They don’t know yet when she’ll be back.” Another TV source says Ripa is currently “refusing to come back” and that while she could decide to return any time, her plan is not to for the rest of this week. A different insider told PEOPLE Ripa was “completely blindsided” by the Tuesday announcement that her co-host Michael Strahan would be leaving the talk show to join Good Morning America as a full time co-anchor in September.  Of Strahan, 44, the TV source says: “He’s a class act. He’s trying to do what he thinks is right, that’s important to him.” A rep for Live! told PEOPLE Ripa “had the day off,” and Ana Gasteyer filled in for the star Wednesday morning. Strahan, 44, meanwhile, took a moment to address his co-host of four years at the end of Wednesday’s segment. “I really want to thank, of course, Kelly Ripa,” he said. “Kelly welcomed me here, and I’ve learned so much from her. She’s just been an amazing influence on me and this has truly changed my life to be here with her.” “And I know that the show will continue to be strong and great because of Kelly … and the staff here because everybody here is so talented,” he added. “This show has not been around for over 30 years by mistake.” “Kelly, I thank you. I love you and everyone else here at Live!, and I’m not going to cry on TV momma, I promise you,” he concluded. Live! With Kelly and Michael airs weekdays (9 a.m. ET) on ABC."
Unconventional #4: Trump’s real magic number; Sanders’ Gary Hart-Ted Kennedy conundrum (and more!),493,"Donald Trump after winning the New York state primary. (Photo: John Moore/Getty Images)Unconventional is Yahoo News’ complete guide to what could be the craziest presidential convention — or conventions — in decades. Here’s what you need to know today.  Donald Trump’s victory Tuesday in his home state of New York was so huge — 60.5 percent of the vote, 89 additional delegates — that Republican insiders are beginning to wonder whether he will really need to hit the magic 1,237 delegate mark by the end of the GOP primary season or whether there’s some lower tipping-point number that would be close enough to make him unstoppable at the convention in Cleveland.“The closer he gets to 1,237, even if he doesn’t get all the way there by the final primaries, the more likely he cobbles it together,” one RNC member told Politico’s Eli Stokols. “There are plenty of delegates that are unbound on first ballot. You’ve just got to go find them.”Trump, for his part, continues to insist that he will cross the 1,237 mark during the primaries. (His campaign thinks it will happen in California — more on that later this week). And Ted Cruz’s team is unlikely to back down just because Trump has almost reached the goal line. As Cruz delegate guru Ken Cuccinelli recently told Unconventional, “When a football team gets into the red zone, you don’t give them a touchdown.”Still, the tipping-point rumors aren’t crazy. Why? Because of those unbound delegates. Under Republican Party rules, delegates from states that hold presidential primaries are bound by those results for at least the first ballot in Cleveland. But  roughly 200 additional delegates  — 34 from West Virginia, 54 from Pennsylvania, and others from Colorado to Wyoming to Guam — are uncommitted. They can vote for whomever they want at the convention. And they can be wooed by the candidates.If Trump performs as well as predicted in next Tuesday’s Eastern primaries — Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island — then sweeps into Indiana and California and New Jersey with the wind at his back, he will wind up very close to 1,237. And if he is close — say, within 100 or so — there will be enough unbound delegates at large (and not leaning toward Cruz) to put him over the top. The question then won’t be about what happened in Iowa or what will happen in Cleveland. It won’t be about what the “Republican Party” wants. It will be about what those 100 human beings want. And in politics, stranger things have happened than 100 human beings deciding that they’d rather not defy the 10 million or so voters who will have cast their ballots for Trump at that point._____As the New York primary results were rolling in Tuesday night, Republican strategist and Ted Cruz supporter Kellyanne Conway and Trump surrogate Omarosa Manigault joined Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric to discuss the possibility of a contested Republican convention. Conway argued that “if you perform well [at state conventions]” — which Cruz has — “it portends that you will perform well at the national convention.” Manigault predicted that a contested convention would be “a complete and total mess.” Unconventional’s take? They’re both right._____ Bernie Sanders at an election rally in Erie, Pa. (Photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters)As you may have heard, Hillary Clinton clobbered Bernie Sanders by 16 percentage points in Tuesday’s New York Democratic primary, adding approximately 35 pledged delegates to her sizable 200-plus-delegate lead and furthering narrowing what’s left of Sanders’ path to the nomination.Among Democrats, the results have prompted yet another round of handwringing about whether the senator from Vermont will continue to campaign with the kind of sharp elbows that characterized his Empire State effort — with Clinton’s chief strategist going so far as to say that if Sanders doesn’t change course in the weeks ahead, he is in danger of  becoming the “Ralph Nader” of 2016  .To be clear: Sanders is no Ralph Nader. In 2000, Nader ran as a third-party candidate and arguably spoiled the entire election for Al Gore. Sanders, meanwhile, has explicitly ruled out a third-party bid. His plan is to prevent Clinton from clinching a majority of pledged delegates during the primaries so that he can battle her over superdelegates — who can switch sides whenever they want — at the convention in Philadelphia. If that plan fails, which it almost certainly will, he will support Clinton in November.Still, the Nader analogy raises an important question: If Sanders is going to campaign all the way to the City of Brotherly Love — to give his supporters closure, to influence the party’s platform, to extract concessions from Clinton — what kind of runner-up does he want to be? How does he want to go out?Fortunately for Sanders, recent Democratic Party history provides two models to choose from: Ted Kennedy in 1980 and Gary Hart in 1984.By the time their respective primary seasons ended, neither Kennedy nor Hart had a realistic shot at the nomination. Yet both continued on to the convention, much as Sanders is threatening to do. The difference is that Hart chose to unify and Kennedy chose to divide.Kennedy’s 1980 primary campaign against incumbent President Jimmy Carter didn’t get off to the smoothest start: Asked why he wanted to be president, Kennedy was unable to invent a coherent answer. He went on to lose nine of the first 10 contests, including Iowa and New Hampshire. Things got a little better from there — Kennedy won a few big Eastern states, like Pennsylvania and New York, and nearly swept the final day of primaries — but when the contests were over, it was Carter who wound up with a majority of the delegates. Enough, technically, to win the nomination — and twice as many as Kennedy.“It’s almost as if Kennedy thought that all he had to do was run and it would happen,” says legendary political reporter Jules Witcover, who covered the campaign for the Baltimore Sun. “Well, it didn’t happen.”Yet Kennedy refused to quit. Convinced that a decisive number of Carter’s pledged delegates secretly supported him, Kennedy swept into the convention agitating for a rule change that would liberate the delegates from their commitments to the candidates and allow them to vote their conscience. His ground troops worked every angle to create roadblocks for Carter on the convention floor. “It was a brutal political fistfight,” according to Harold Ickes, who helped shape Kennedy’s convention strategy and later became Bill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff.Carter clinched the nomination anyway. In his acceptance speech, he made sure to praise Kennedy and plead for his support against Ronald Reagan. But even then, Kennedy wouldn’t go quietly. When the time came for the balloons to drop, it took Kennedy 20 minutes to materialize onstage. As Carter later put it in his White House diary, Kennedy “seemed to have had a few drinks.” He shook Carter’s hand perfunctorily, then made a beeline for the wings. And “there followed a comical ballet,” according to the Washington Post, in which Carter & Co. basically chased Kennedy back and forth across the stage for an arms-up unity pose with the president. They never got the shot.“Ted Kennedy didn’t feel that Carter had been a good president,” says Witcover. “He really wanted him out of there. He wanted to restore Camelot. And it was hard to let go.”Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, right, meets with former rival, Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, in San Francisco before the start of the final session of the Democratic National Convention, July 19, 1984. (Photo: Scott Stewart/AP)In reporting on “Kennedy’s appearance with me on the platform after my speech,” Carter later wrote, “the news stories emphasized his lack of enthusiasm as an indication that the split in our ranks had not been healed. This accurate impression was quite damaging to our campaign and was to linger for a long time.”Four years later, Hart could have followed Kennedy’s lead. In fact, he performed better than Kennedy had in the primaries, trading wins with Vice President Walter Mondale throughout the process. He won California on June 5, seven of the last 11 contests, and more overall than Mondale had. He was polling 10 points better than Mondale against Reagan. If not for a 15-point loss in New Jersey on the final day of voting, Hart might have had a real chance at the convention in San Francisco. But like Kennedy — and in all probability, like Sanders — he didn’t have the delegates. On June 6, Mondale claimed he had 2,008 delegates pledged to him, or 41 more than the magic number of 1,967 needed to nominate.Still, Hart persisted, spending the interregnum between the last primary and the start of the convention trying to woo unbound superdelegates — again, just like Sanders plans to do. In San Francisco, he added a peace plank to the party’s platform, secured a prime-time speaking slot, and convinced Mondale to help him retire his $4.5 million campaign debt. He even collaborated with Jesse Jackson, the third-place finisher, in an attempt to deny Mondale a victory on the first ballot.But it was not to be. The final tally was 2,191 delegates, or 56 percent, for Mondale; 1,201, or 31 percent, for Hart; and 466, or 12 percent, for Jackson.Hart rushed back to the podium to call for the nomination by acclamation. “There is a time to fight,” he said, “and a time to unite.”“Gary Hart was more or less motivated by own political ambition,” says Witcover. “He wasn’t an ideologue.” Even though he fell short, the 1984 campaign had been a success. Four years later, Hart would vie for the presidency again — this time as the Democratic frontrunner.The question now facing Sanders is how he will define success — and how that will shape the rest of his campaign. There were signs Tuesday that at least one of Sanders’ advisers, top strategist Tad Devine — an alum, it’s worth noting, of Carter ’80 and Mondale ’84 — was reassessing the whole “flipping superdelegate” strategy.“Next week is a big week,” Devine told the Associated Press. “We’ll see how we do there, and then we’ll be able to sit back and assess where we are.”Witcover, for one, thinks that Sanders has always been more interested in policy than the presidency. “I don’t think you have the same prospect of hostility and then pushing back at the convention with Sanders,” he says. “Sanders is obviously motivated by his policies. When he talks about a revolution, that is what he is talking about. He wins if he has a voice at the convention — if he pulls Clinton further to the left. In that sense, he has already won.”_____ A Trump supporter amuses the crowd at a Trump campaign rally in Plattsburgh, N.Y.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager doesn’t understand Bernie Sanders’ rationale for a delegate fight,800,"Fresh off Hillary Clinton’s victory over Bernie Sanders in the New York Democratic primary, her campaign manager, Robby Mook, says he believes she’ll soon have the magic number of delegates needed to secure the nomination — and doesn’t understand the Sanders campaign’s vow to take its fight to the convention.“I don’t see a clear path for them at this point,” Mook told Yahoo News’ Katie Couric on Tuesday night. “The numbers are pretty daunting.”Clinton, Mook pointed out, is winning both the popular vote and has the edge on the Vermont senator among pledged delegates.But Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, told MSNBC that even if the Vermont senator fails to catch up to Clinton in those categories, they’re going to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia to try and woo the so-called superdelegates anyway.“We’re going to go to the convention,” Weaver said. “It’s extremely unlikely that either candidate will have the requisite number of pledged delegates [to clinch the nomination]. It’s going to be an election determined by the superdelegates.”“I find that kind of odd,” Mook said. “When Hillary walks into that convention leading with the popular vote, leading with the pledged delegates, I don’t understand the rationale for all these superdelegates to suddenly support Sen. Sanders.”On the eve of the New York primary, Bernie Sanders’ wife Jane called the superdelegate system “silly.”“They’re 30 percent of the vote that a candidate needs to become the nominee,” she told the Daily Beast. “How fair is that? I am a voter. I have one vote, yet you’re a superdelegate and count for thousands and thousands of votes. That doesn’t make any sense at all. ‘One person, one vote’ is what democracy is supposed to be about.”Meanwhile, Mook says he isn’t worried about a protracted primary and thinks Clinton will reach the magic number by mid-June.“I’m not concerned with the primary going until the end,” he said. “I think Hillary, by the end of the primary, by the time the states on June 7 and June 14 vote, it’ll be clear who the nominee is gonna be.”However, Mook is concerned that Sanders’ recent “personal attacks” against the former secretary could hurt her in the fall.“I think their campaign needs to decide, ‘Are we engaging in a debate on issues, or are we going to have a scorched earth campaign, call into question Hillary’s character and ultimately aid and abet Republicans?’” Mook said."
Populists vs. elites — America’s other favorite pastime,355,"A Trump supporter at a campaign rally in Plattsburgh, N.Y., in April. (Photo: Elise Amendola/AP)In recent days, Donald Trump and Paul Manafort, his new convention manager, have charged that Ted Cruz’s campaign is seeking to steal the election right out from under Trump. “Gestapo tactics,” moaned Manafort, casting aspersions on Cruz’s recent victory over Trump at Colorado’s Republican convention, as if Cruz had somehow rigged it in his favor.Trump may yet win through the primary process the 1,237 delegates he must secure in order to capture the nomination in Cleveland outright. Yet it is now at least reasonably possible that he won’t cross that threshold, that Ted Cruz will finish a relatively close second, and that at least some Republican leaders will land in Cleveland fantasizing about Paul Ryan — despite his Shermanesque vow not to be drafted as their nominee — or another as-yet-unnamed savior who in the late July heat can save their party from moral ruin and political annihilation. A contested convention in Cleveland would be dramatic and fascinating to behold, of course. Since 1952, the United States has not experienced a convention battle that has gone beyond the first ballot.Nonetheless, what makes the upcoming fight in Cleveland even more fraught — and more important to the character of American democracy — is that we will be witnessing a debate between populists and elites that has been raging, off and on, since the early days of the republic. Millions of Americans have long felt disenfranchised by what they see as out-of-touch plutocrats who feather their own nests at the expense of the common citizen. Elite efforts to check outbreaks of popular dissatisfaction, in turn, have long preoccupied political leaders. The Founding Fathers had a well-known fear of uneducated masses electing demagogues to high office, a fear that is once again ascendant among some of Trump’s fiercest critics. The GOP today is roiled by a fundamental conflict between the Trumpian masses claiming popular grassroots support for their man (raising the specter of an undemocratic coup) and Republican officials who see the Trump movement as democracy run amok (a vitriolic minority hijacking true Republican virtues).The language of Trump and his supporters is consonant with the mass suspicion of distant elites who control economic and political systems to the detriment of white working men and women — with deep roots in the culture. “It’s a rigged, disgusting, dirty system,” Trump told New Yorkers last week, referring to the complex, arcane delegate selection process. One of his rallygoers told CNN.com, “Here is the Republican Party, instead of listening to its constituents, who are saying this is what we want, they’re not backing him up. Instead they’re rallying against him … they’re rallying against us.”Trump’s supporters will also come to the convention armed with a shared sense of cultural grievance. In their telling, the economic and political systems have harmed them while favoring corporate titans, illegal immigrants and Muslims — all of whom, in the Trumpian worldview, are making America not great but actually unrecognizable. The Trump phenomenon is thus rooted in the combustible intersection of race, immigration and economic nationalism that has at times helped fuel populist uprisings of decades past.The original populists — agrarian Western and Southern farmers of the late 19th century — decried Eastern bankers who were said to be choking off the money supply, making it hard for them to get credit and pay off their debts, and urban industrialists who were destroying the agrarian character of a Jeffersonian America. Decades later, during the Great Depression, followers of Louisiana’s “Kingfish” Huey Long rallied to his redistributionist “Share Our Wealth” battle cry, while the radio priest Father Coughlin’s supporters were likewise drawn to his everyman calls for economic equity. Both figures ultimately sought to return a measure of autonomy and control back to individuals and communities feeling disempowered by an ever larger modern industrial state. As the historian Alan Brinkley has written, mass politics has represented to some observers “the victory of the dark forces that have in the [20th] century produced fascism, Stalinism, and other terrors,” while other critics have portrayed it as “the rational and entirely justified responses to oppression and injustice.” The debate about the nature of Trump’s movement — fueled by legitimate grievances or subterranean forces — has been framed in similar terms.Trump and his millions of passionate voters distrust conservative pundits, elected and unelected officials, and the wealthy Republican donors who are sinking millions into anti-Trump super-PACs. Republican elites distrust Trump’s followers as ignorant, racist and vengeful. From Bill Kristol to Mitt Romney, countless Republicans have endorsed a Never Trump movement, with its own hashtag, which is grounded in the conviction that Trump’s demagoguery, racism and anti-market stances on issues like trade not only affront the tenets of conservatism but also coarsen and endanger tolerance, freedom and American life.A dialogue — online and in the mainstream and conservative press alike — has raised questions about Trump voters’ intelligence, values and ethics. “Tell those people [voting for Trump] the truth” about Trump’s fraudulence, urged columnist David Brooks last month, aiming his message at Republican officials. “Trump’s Supporters Aren’t Stupid,” read a headline in Medium, the online forum, raising the prospect that some are, indeed, stupid. “Are Donald Trump’s Supporters Racist?” asked a headline in the Atlantic. Trump’s voters, Vox.com reported, “have a history of voting for segregationists and a tendency to support those with authoritarian philosophies.” His supporters, critics charge, are thuggish, conspiratorial and susceptible to Trump’s lies, which they are said to take at face value. By blocking Trump from the nomination, even if they lose the 2016 election to Hillary Clinton, the Never Trump forces can claim that they saved the Republican Party from Trump’s mass politics, and America from the kind of demagogues fueled by unruly mass support that the founders warned about.The battle in Cleveland will be more than a fight for a majority of delegates — more, even, than a struggle to determine the future of the conservative movement and the Republican Party. Cleveland will be the site of a clash of sharply contrasting worldviews, in which Trumpian populists who see mass politics as virtuous will be pitted against conservative writers, politicians, activists and strategists who regard mass politics of the Trumpian variety as inimical to democracy itself. Each side scorns the other; each side believes the other side represents a threat to the American way.___Matthew Dallek, an assistant professor at George Washington’s Graduate School of Political Management, is co-author of Inside Campaigns: Elections Through the Eyes of Political Professionals and author of the forthcoming Defenseless Under the Night: The Roosevelt Years and the Origins of Homeland Security (Oxford University Press, June)."
Three Michigan officials charged in Flint toxic water crisis,1922,"By Serena Maria DanielsFLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Three Michigan state and local officials were criminally charged on Wednesday in an investigation into dangerous lead levels in the city of Flint’s drinking water, and the state attorney general said there would be more to come.Genesee District Judge Tracy Collier-Nix authorized charges against Flint employee Michael Glasgow and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) employees Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby.Glasgow, 40, was charged with tampering with evidence and willful neglect of duty, according to court documents.Busch, 40, and Prysby, 53, were each charged with six counts, including misconduct in office, tampering with evidence and violation of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, according to court documents. Busch, a district manager in the drinking water division, had already been suspended.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette told a news conference to announce the charges that it was “only the beginning and there will be more to come.”The three people charged could not immediately be reached for comment. Glasgow faces up to five years in prison and $6,000 in fines, while the two MDEQ officials each face up to 20 years in prison and $45,000 in fines, according to court documents.Officials with the city of Flint and MDEQ could not be reached for comment.Dena Altheide, a court administrator, said court dates and arraignments had not been set.Flint, which has about 100,000 people, was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 when it switched its source of water from Detroit’s municipal system to the Flint River to save money. The city switched back in October.The river water was more corrosive than the Detroit system’s and caused more lead to leach from its aging pipes. Lead can be toxic and children are especially vulnerable. The crisis has prompted lawsuits by parents who say their children are showing dangerously high blood levels of lead.In January, the attorney general named a special prosecutor to lead the investigation into whether criminal charges should be filed in the water crisis.In February, former Wayne County prosecutor Todd Flood, who has led the probe, said his team would look at what possible crimes were committed in the crisis.“The criminal charges against MDEQ officials are one step towards justice for the families of Flint who were poisoned as a result of the actions of Governor (Rick) Snyder’s administration,” U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, said in a statement. Cummings and other House Democrats have called for Snyder to step down because of the state’s poor handling of the crisis, something the governor has said he would not do.Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder, said the governor has supported the probe “because the people of Flint and across Michigan are owed straight answers about how the Flint water crisis happened.” The governor has said the state would pursue evidence of wrongdoing and hold people accountable.(Writing and reporting by Ben Klayman; additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Susan Cornwell and Susan Heavey in Washington; editing by Diane Craft)"
It was not a good night for Ted Cruz ...,29,"Ted Cruz attends a Pennsylvania campaign kickoff event held on New York presidential primary night at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, April 19, 2016. Ted Cruz won less than 15% of the vote and no delegates at the Republican primary in New York on Tuesday, a disappointing performance that blunted his momentum and renewed questions about the broad appeal of his campaign.The Texas senator wasn’t expected to do well in New York, but as he fights to win as many delegates as possible before the Republican convention this summer, a complete and total loss in the delegate-rich New York hurt his chances at a nomination fight in Cleveland.And it’s now mathematically impossible for Cruz to clinch the Republican nomination through pledged delegates won in state contests.Instead, Cruz’s strategy is focused on preventing his main rival, frontrunner Donald Trump, from getting the required 1,237 delegates to lock down the Republican presidential nomination outright heading into the convention.If Trump falls short of that number in the delegates he wins through state contests, it could force a contested convention in which many delegates who would be bound to vote for Trump on the first ballot could choose another candidate on subsequent ballots.But Trump is now pulling even farther ahead of Cruz on the delegate count. He has locked down 845 delegates to Cruz’s 559, according to The Associated Press.And Trump is polling well in California, which awards 172 delegates and holds its primary in June, with Cruz in second place.(REUTERS/Charles Mostoller) Trump also had a better night than most analysts predicted in New York. He took home at least 89 delegates from his home state, according to The Associated Press, as well as more than 60% of the vote.Cruz was hurt among the New York electorate by a lack of evangelicals and strong conservatives, groups with which he typically does well, according to preliminary exit polls from ABC News. And most Republican voters (61%) said they were looking for an “outsider” candidate. Trump overwhelmingly won with this group of people, taking 85% of their votes.But despite the odds, Cruz is still pushing forward in the race for the Republican nomination. In a speech Tuesday night, Cruz spoke of needing to “unite” the party and restore Americans’ “rightful place in the world.”He spoke of the words that he said have become the “vision” of his campaign.“Not, ‘Yes, we can,’ but now, 'Yes, we will,’” he told supporters in Pennsylvania.The Republican process now moves on to contests next Tuesday in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania, all states considered favorable to the real-estate mogul.NOW WATCH: Scientists have linked the deaths of three US presidents to the same surprising causeMore From Business Insider"
"After big New York wins, Trump and Clinton cast themselves as inevitable",838,"By Emily Flitter and Luciana LopezNEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton scored sweeping victories in nominating contests in their home state of New York, and immediately cited those wins to argue that they are all but unstoppable as their respective parties’ presidential nominees.Trump’s crushing defeat of Ted Cruz in Tuesday’s primary election tilted the energy in the Republican race back to the front-runner, just as Republican National Committee members begin meeting in Florida on Wednesday to discuss their July convention, where the nominee will be chosen.For the Democratic favorite, Clinton’s more narrow victory over Bernie Sanders snapped a string of victories by the 74-year-old democratic socialist and gave her a much-needed lift with more tough fights ahead.The eventual victors of the Democratic and the Republican nominating campaigns will face each other in November’s general election.Trump’s win, celebrated to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” at Trump Tower in Manhattan, marked a rebound from his Wisconsin defeat two weeks ago. It set him up for another big night on April 26, when Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Maryland will hold primaries.With a campaign staff reboot and a more focused performance, Trump has sought to improve in recent weeks as a candidate. The tone of his victory speech was in keeping with a more measured style the often-brash billionaire has adopted.“We don’t have much of a race anymore based on what I’m seeing on television,” Trump said as television networks projected a large margin of victory for him. “Senator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated.”Trump, 69, predicted some “amazing weeks” ahead for his campaign.Still, he has a long way to go to seal the nomination and begin trying to heal the wounds in his bitterly divided party. Some fence-mending may happen when he sends campaign advisers to the RNC meeting starting in Hollywood, Florida, on Wednesday.Trump’s haul of most of New York’s 95 delegates moved him closer to the 1,237 needed to win the nomination outright. Anything short of that will lead to a contested convention when Republicans hold their national conclave July 18-21 in Cleveland.“There’s only two issues left for Republicans: Will Trump get 50 percent of the delegates prior to Cleveland, and if not, how close will he be? New York gives him a nice boost, but it will take weeks before we know the answer,” said Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.Cruz, a 45-year-old U.S. senator from Texas, came in third in New York and gave his primary night speech in Philadelphia, where he was already focused on running in Pennsylvania. He called on Republicans to unite around his candidacy.Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, a long-shot candidate, is seeking to use his second-place showing in New York as proof he is emerging as Trump’s central challenger in the states that come up next on the calendar.NO KNOCKOUT PUNCH FOR CLINTONClinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, former secretary of state and former first lady, got nowhere near the knockout punch she needed to finally put Sanders away.But the broad smile on her face as she gave her victory speech spoke volumes about how important New York was to her bid to become the first female U.S. president.“Today you proved once again there’s no place like home,” Clinton said. “This one was personal.”The race for the Democratic nomination, she said, is now in “the home stretch, and victory is in sight.”Clinton, 68, was to campaign in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Sanders flew home to Vermont to take a day off the campaign trail.Clinton’s win made it nearly impossible for Sanders to overtake her commanding lead in delegates needed to win the nomination.Dilawar Syed, a tech entrepreneur who is also the co-founder and vice chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund, a Super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian-American voters, said it looked like Clinton has the nomination.“Clearly Senator Sanders has a lot of supporters and enthusiasm there. He also has raised a lot of good resources,“ Syed said. ""I think the primary will go on for some time. But just looking at the numbers, we know where this is going.”Sanders’ campaign vowed to fight on until the Democrats’ nominating convention in Philadelphia July 25-28.“Look, we’re going to go to the convention,“ Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told MSNBC. He said it was extremely unlikely that either candidate would have the delegates needed to win the nomination outright.Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Clinton has a delicate balancing act in trying to draw in Sanders supporters while pivoting to a general election matchup against the Republican nominee.“She runs a risk. If she goes too far to the left (to draw in Sanders supporters), she’s going to upset independents and others that she’s going to need in the general,” Manley said.Nationally, the race for the nominations has tightened recently for both parties, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday.Clinton and Sanders are tied among Democrats, with each drawing about 47 percent support in the national poll. At the beginning of the year, Clinton led Sanders by nearly a 2-to-1 margin; Sanders has closed that gap over the past few months.Among Republicans, Trump leads with 44 percent support, compared with 33 percent for Cruz and 16 percent for Kasich.The April 15-19 poll surveyed 719 Democrats and 593 Republicans. It has a credibility interval of 4.7 percentage points.(Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Megan Casella in Washington, Jonathan Allen in New York and Emily Stephenson in Philadelphia; Writing by Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
Hillary Clinton and her allies delivered a clear message to Bernie Sanders after her big win in New York,2204,"Halfway through Hillary Clinton’s victory speech following her win in the New York Democratic primary, she had a not-so-subtle message to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters.“To all the people who supported Sen. Sanders, I believe there’s much more that unites us than divides us,” Clinton said.In a nod toward the general-election campaign to come, she added: “The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight.”Tuesday night’s overwhelming victory came as a welcome relief for Clinton supporters. The delegate-rich New York primary contest was long a potential bright spot on the primary calendar as the former secretary of state racked up several losses in smaller primaries and caucuses over the past several weeks.Speaking to reporters after Clinton’s primary-night party, Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign’s communications director, highlighted the steep electoral math for Sanders to overtake the former secretary of state’s massive pledged-delegate lead.Though she did not call on the senator to drop out, Palmieri emphasized that the campaign would have to prove why it was staying in the election after the contests wrap up.“We do think that it is certainly within his right to go all the way,” Palmieri said of Sanders’ pledge to continue campaigning until the Democratic convention in July. “But we hope that at the end of the contests, she will lead the popular vote, she will lead in pledged delegates. At that point, they will have to prove to you how they will win the nomination.” Palmieri also criticized Sanders’ attacks in a primary that has become snippy of late, and she called on the the senator's campaign to tone down his rhetoric and focus on policy differences.(AP) Hillary Clinton. “What he said he would never do is run a negative campaign that is not about issues. We believe that he needs to return to campaigning about issues,” Palmieri said.She continued: “There’s no question that the behavior of Sen. Sanders and his campaign has been destructive, and it’s not productive for Democrats.”The Sanders campaign isn’t publicly ready to throw in the towel.In the month leading up to the primary, Sanders staffers maintained that the insurgent Democratic presidential candidate could pull off an upset in the Empire State. But as the polls solidified ahead of the primary, his advisers attempted to downplay the state’s significance.Asked last Thursday whether Sanders needed to win in New York, senior Sanders advisor Tad Devine said that if the campaign beat expectations in later contests, the senator still had a shot.“I think we have to do well here in New York, but there are plenty of events between here and California and Washington, DC, at the end for us to make up the difference,” Devine said.He added: “I’m not going to say that we are going to win every contest between now and the middle of June, but we are going to win most of them, we are going to win by far most of the delegates, we can make up the pledged delegate differential. And I believe, when the voting is over, we will be ahead in pledged delegates.”Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, projected a similar message after Sanders’ loss Tuesday night. He even suggested that the campaign would look to flip so-called superdelegates ahead of the Democratic convention.“Look, we’re going to go to the convention,” he said on MSNBC. “It is extremely unlikely that either candidate will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to get to this number. … It's going to be an election determined by the superdelegates.”NOW WATCH: A hair surgeon explains what’s going on with Trump’s hairMore From Business Insider"
Primary day in New York,15,"Voters in New York went to the polls Tuesday in a pivotal presidential primary, with frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump making big wins in the state, as they seek to clinch the Democratic and Republican nominations.Final results were not yet tallied, but Clinton — the former secretary of state, first lady and New York senator — had a single-digit lead over her Brooklyn-born challenger, Bernie Sanders, clearing her path to the nomination.Trump, the brash Manhattan billionaire whose controversial campaign has appalled the Republican establishment, won overwhelmingly, and was considered likely to win most of the 95 delegates available. His rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich was likely to win only a few delegates, while Texas Sen.

"Trump trounces in New York primary, pushes toward 1,237",2586,"NEW YORK — Donald Trump easily won New York’s Republican presidential primary Tuesday, a significant home state victory that is likely to give new momentum to the GOP frontrunner’s campaign after weeks of turmoil.“It’s just incredible,” Trump declared, as he spoke inside the atrium of Trump Tower in Manhattan surrounded by his family and at least 100 cheering friends and supporters. “We’re gonna end at a very high level, and get a lot more delegates than anybody projected, even in their wildest imagination.”Though the results were still being tallied, Trump appeared to be in a strong position to win close to the 95 delegates at stake Tuesday, expanding the real estate mogul’s already sizable delegate lead over his closest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But it was unclear if Trump’s home state win will be enough to stave off a contested Republican convention this summer.While Trump has won the majority of votes in the GOP race so far, his campaign was slow to get a handle on the delegate race and has been outmaneuvered in several states, including Louisiana, Colorado and Wyoming, by the Cruz campaign in recent weeks. But Cruz, who has positioned himself as the chief alternative to Trump, suffered a significant setback on Tuesday, placing a distant third in the primary behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Though Cruz did not expect to win New York, his poor showing put him at risk of emerging Tuesday with no delegates at all.Donald Trump speaks to reporters at a primary-night event at Trump Tower in New York City on Tuesday. (Photo: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters) Speaking to reporters about Cruz’s fortunes on Tuesday night, Trump declared, “We don’t have much of a race anymore based on what I am seeing. … It’s impossible to catch us.”Slideshow: Primary day in New York >>> For Trump, the win in New York was a psychological boost for his campaign, which has been under pressure amid delegate intrigue and Cruz’s victory in Wisconsin two weeks ago. And it came at a crucial time, giving Trump momentum heading into a slate of Northeastern states believed to be favorable to his campaign, including Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Rhode Island, which hold GOP primaries on April 26.But Tuesday’s victory also came amid rumors of staff turmoil as Trump has sought to reshuffle and expand his campaign infrastructure in the face of a delegate race that could make or break his insurgent White House bid. After his loss in Wisconsin, Trump gave new power to Paul Manafort, a longtime GOP hand whom he tapped as his convention manager.That has raised questions about the future and influence of Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, who has been embroiled in scandal in recent weeks after tangling with a female reporter at a Trump event last month. Initially charged with simple battery in the case, he was cleared last week. But rumors have persisted that Manafort is essentially taking over Lewandowski’s portfolio, as Trump has granted him new powers to hire and fire staff and build a ground operation heading into crucial upcoming primaries like California’s. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, talks to the media before the candidate’s primary-night rally in Manhattan. (Photo: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)Slideshow: The battle for New York >>> On Monday, Stuart Jolly, a close ally of Lewandowski, abruptly resigned as Trump’s campaign field director. The move came just days after Trump, at Manafort’s suggestion, hired Rick Wiley, a longtime GOP operative who previously ran Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s failed presidential bid, to be his new political director.But even as Manafort appears to be expanding his power within the campaign, Lewandowski has pushed back against claims of his waning influence. On Tuesday night, the longtime Trump aide positioned himself front and center during his boss’s campaign event, making himself available to reporters at least twice. And when Trump sauntered to the podium to the strains of Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” Lewandowski stood at his boss’s right elbow, along with the Trump family.Trump thanked his staff and denied rumors of campaign infighting. “My team has been amazing. And you know, it’s actually a team of unity,” he insisted.And he criticized the media for focusing on his staff squabbling, insisting it was making a story where there is none. “It’s evolving,” Trump said of his campaign team. “People don’t understand that. The press does understand it. They just don’t want to talk about it.”But even as Trump touted the unity of his team, there were hints of Manafort’s influence in his remarks Tuesday. He took a decidedly more sober tone, referring to his chief rival as “Senator Cruz,” rather than “Lyin’ Ted,” as had become one of his election night trademarks. And it had been expected that Trump would take questions from the assembled press corps, but instead he spoke for less than 10 minutes and then stepped away from the podium, a rarity for a candidate known for his rambling press conferences.Before he walked away, Trump thanked the voters of his home state. “I can think of nowhere that I would rather have this victory,” he said. “We love New York.” (Cover thumbnail photo: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)"
A noticeably different Donald Trump showed up to celebrate his big New York victory,6,"There was no “Lyin’ Ted.” No “Crooked Hillary.” No steak.An apparently subdued Donald Trump delivered a raucous victory speech at New York City’s Trump Tower after winning the state’s Republican primary.When referring to his chief rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump ditched his favored moniker — “Lyin’ Ted” — instead calling him “Senator Cruz.”Many political observers noted the switch.During his speech, Trump took shots at Cruz — but refrained from his typical insults.“Sen. Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated,” Trump said. “And we’ve won another state.”Trump didn’t entirely abandon his signature rhetoric — he repeated many of his usual talking points on veterans, illegal immigration, and making America great again — but he still appeared significantly restrained.Trump is the clear frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination and is ahead of his rivals in the delegate count. But it’s still possible that he may face a contested convention this summer. A Republican candidate needs to win 1,237 delegates through state contests to lock down the party’s nomination, and right now it’s uncertain whether Trump will have that number by July.If Trump faces a contested convention, in which many delegates who would be bound to Trump on the first ballot could switch their vote to another candidate on subsequent ballots, it would help for him to have the support of establishment officials in his party.With this and the delegate race in mind, Trump has shifted the focus of his campaign.

Not ‘Yes we can,’ but now, ‘Yes we will.’”Cruz also made an unusual analogy to wrestling or yoga, depending on which mat you prefer.“America has always been best when she is lying down with her back on the mat,” he said.Sen.

Sanders has no clear path to victory after his loss in New York,7419,"NEW YORK — Sen. Bernie Sanders fell short in New York’s Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday as he was defeated by his rival, Hillary Clinton.With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton won by over 15 percent, a clearly decisive margin. Even a narrow win for the former secretary of state in the delegate-rich state would have gone a long way toward blocking Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination.Clinton spoke to supporters at a hotel in Times Square shortly after the results were announced. She thanked the voters in New York, where she lives and served as a senator from 2001 until 2009.“Today, you proved once again there’s no place like home!” she said.Hillary Clinton celebrates her victory in the New York presidential primary at a rally in Manhattan. (Photo: Mike Segar/Reuters) Clinton also took a shot at earlier attacks from the Sanders campaign that attributed her success solely to her victories in Southern states.“You know, in this campaign, we’ve won in every region of the country, from the North, to the South, to the East, to the West,” said Clinton, adding, “But this one’s personal.”Slideshow: Primary day in New York >>> Sanders won eight of the last nine contests leading up to the New York primary, but Clinton’s earlier wins ensured that he needed to defeat her in the state — and every other one on the remaining primary calendar — by at least 12 points. With a win in New York, Clinton has raised the bar for Sanders even higher in the states to come.Sanders addressed nearly 7,000 of his supporters in a field house at Penn State University several hours before the polls closed in New York and results were announced. He pointed to his recent momentum to argue Clinton was “getting a little bit nervous.”“This is the campaign that has the energy, that has the enthusiasm and that in November will create the kind of voter turnout that will not only allow us to retain the White House, but will regain the U.S. Senate,” he said.There’s no question Sanders has gained steam in the last few weeks. In addition to his recent streak, polls showed Clinton’s lead heading into New York diminish by about 20 points in the past month. At the debate last Thursday, Sanders’ senior adviser, Tad Devine, said this momentum  would be a key part of the campaign’s strategy going forward. Devine argued that Sanders did not need New York to secure the nomination. He suggested that recent polls showing that Sanders is a stronger general election candidate than Clinton would convince voters and the party’s superdelegates to back his candidacy.“I think the Democratic Party is going to look at two candidate and realize that Bernie Sanders, by far, is the strongest candidate for our party,” Devine said.The Sanders campaign has also pointed to alleged voting irregularities in the New York race. Multiple local officials have identified issues at the polls, and on Monday, the state Board of Elections revealed that approximately 126,000 Democrats had been removed from the state’s voter rolls. New York election law does not permit voters who are not registered members of the party to participate in the primary. Sanders spokeswoman Erika Andiola released a statement on Tuesday saying that the campaign was “deeply disturbed by what we’re hearing from polling places across the state.”Sen. Bernie Sanders greets community members during a walk on East Fordham Road in the Bronx, N.Y., on Monday. (Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP)Slideshow: The battle for New York >>>“From long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered New Yorkers being dropped from the rolls, what’s happening today is a disgrace,” Andiola said. “We need to be making it easier for people to vote, not inventing arbitrary obstacles — and today’s shameful demonstration must underline the urgent importance of fixing voting laws across the country.”The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the alleged irregularities.Sanders also addressed New York’s election laws in his Pennsylvania speech.“Today in New York state — if you can believe this — about 27 percent of the eligible voters in that state are unable to participate in the Democratic or Republican primaries because they have chosen to list themselves as independents,” he said, as his supporters booed. “That’s wrong. Almost 3 million people in that state cannot vote today. And that has got to change in future elections.”On Tuesday afternoon, as people voted in the primary, a group called Election Justice USA filed a suit in federal court arguing that the registration of over 200 voters had been switched without their input, preventing them from participating.  Election Justice USA’s website describes the group as a “a national voting rights organization,” and a spokesperson has described the group as nonpartisan. However, the site was only created on April 11, and all seven of the people listed as members of the “Election Justice USA team” have made online posts expressing support for Sanders. In Facebook posts on April 12, two members of the group, Michael Rayer-Tighe and Stewart McCauley, described the lawsuit as an effort to help Sanders.“There are potentially thousands of Bernie supporters who registered as Dem before the deadline but won’t be allowed to vote next week,” the posts said. “We at Election Justice USA are filing an emergency injunction to address this issue.”The posts by the Election Justice USA team members also encouraged people to “Help Bernie” by checking their registration and contacting the group and the campaign about any potential issues.When asked about Election Justice USA by Yahoo News, a Sanders campaign spokesman, Karthik Ganapathy, described the group as “an organization of volunteers operating entirely independently from the campaign.”In addition to her lead in the polls, Clinton had the backing of much of the state’s political establishment, including the entire congressional delegation, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Even if he had had ideal circumstances, Sanders was facing an uphill battle in New York, and after tonight, his path through the remaining states is even steeper.Hillary Clinton arrives with her daughter, Chelsea, right, to celebrate her victory at her New York presidential primary night rally. (Photo: Mike Segar/Reuters)Although Clinton pointed to upcoming states on the primary calendar and indicated she plans to stay on the campaign trail, she also seemed to be pivoting toward the general election, attacking the Republican frontrunners, Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. The Democratic primary has been divisive at times, with Sanders attacking Clinton from the left and attempting to paint her as a tool of the moneyed establishment. In her speech Tuesday, Clinton repeatedly described her campaign and platform as “progressive"" and urged Sanders’ backers to unite behind her.“To all the people who supported Sen. Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us,” Clinton said.Additional reporting from Liz Goodwin in State College, Pa._____(Cover thumbnail photo: Kathy Willens/AP)"
Sanders calls New York’s closed primary ‘wrong’,101,"STATE COLLEGE, Penn.—Bernie Sanders told thousands of his supporters Tuesday evening that the believed New York’s closed primary system is “wrong.” He also predicted he will perform better than expected in the state.Sanders tried to play down Clinton’s likely victory in New York Tuesday to the packed crowd on Penn State’s campus. (Polls close in New York at 9 p.m.) He railed against New York’s closed primary system, where only registered Democrats can vote for the party’s nominee. Sanders has done better in open primary states.“Today in New York State if you can believe this, about 27 percent of the eligible voters in that state are unable to participate in the Democratic or Republican primaries because they have chosen to list themselves as independents,” he said. “That’s wrong. Almost 3 million people in that state cannot vote today. And that has got to change in future elections.”Slideshow: The battle for New York >>>In New York, residents had to register as either Democrat or Republican by last October to vote in Tuesday’s primary. There were also reports of voting problems Tuesday. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that some Democratic voters had been improperly removed from the rolls in Brooklyn, and called for the Board of Elections to be reformed.Sanders said despite New York’s “establishment” backing Clinton, he thinks he will perform well in the state. “You know what? We’re going to do just fine tonight in New York.”Clinton’s team has argued that the senator has no path to the nomination at this point and should bow out, but the senator made a passionate case for why he is the better choice.“I don’t want you to tell anybody about this, but Secretary Clinton is getting a little bit nervous,” he said, to cheers from the crowd. “This is the campaign that has the energy, that has the enthusiasm and that in November will create the kind of voter turnout that will not only allow us to retain the White House but will regain the U.S. Senate.“Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign rally at Hunters Point park, in the Queens borough of New York.

Bernie Sanders is from Brooklyn; Donald Trump is from Queens; Hillary Clinton owns a home north of the city in Westchester County and represented New York in the U.S. Senate.

"At encryption hearing, lawmakers search in vain for workable solutions",161,"Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell. (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP).Congressional committee members questioned security experts, law enforcement officials and Apple’s head lawyer in a congressional hearing on Tuesday, marking the second time in two months that lawmakers have sought to understand both the risks and benefits that encryption poses to modern society.The nearly four-hour hearing comes less than a month after the FBI abandoned a controversial case against Apple, in which the federal agency sought to compel the tech company’s help to access the iPhone of a San Bernardino shooter. After encountering heavy opposition from activists, academics, tech companies and lawmakers, forensic investigators found a last-minute solution to break into the Apple device by instead hiring “an outside party,” whose identity it has not revealed. Since then, however, the agency has continued to pursue legal access to Apple’s  encrypted devices in a pending court case.Related: Congress moving ahead on encryption vs. terrorism debateThe testimonies offered Tuesday addressed several technical and ethical issues surrounding the government’s regulation of encryption, as well as questions about how it plans to balance the requirements of national security and individual privacy in a technologically driven world. As Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said in her opening statement to the committee: “None of our conversations seem to be focused on workable solutions. What I want to hear today is from both law enforcement and industry about possible solutions going forward.”Witnesses from the law enforcement side included FBI assistant director Amy Hess, Indiana state police captain Charles Cohen, and New York City intelligence bureau police chief Thomas Galati. They were joined by MIT research scientist Daniel Weitzner, University of Pennsylvania associate professor of computer science Matt Blaze, RSA security firm president Amit Yoran, and Apple’s general counsel Bruce Sewell.FBI assistant director Amy Hess with New York City police intelligence bureau chief Thomas Galati, center, and Indiana state police captain Charles Cohen. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP).Most notably, Hess said that the FBI’s strategy to use a third-party mobile forensic expert in the San Bernardino case was not a reliable method for accessing evidence in the future.“These solutions are very case by case specific,” she said in reply to a question from DeGette. “They may not work in all instances. Also, they’re very time-intensive and resource-intensive, which may not be scalable to enable us to be successful in our investigations.”DeGette, who referenced the FBI’s decision to use a “gray hat” party to help open the phone in the San Bernardino case, followed up by asking why the government couldn’t develop its own sophisticated techniques for breaking into devices.“I don’t see that as possible,” Hess responded. “I think that we really need the cooperation of industry, we need the cooperation of academia, we need the cooperation of the private sector in order to come up with solutions.”Hess’ testimony contradicts the suggestions of numerous security experts —including encryption expert Susan Landau, who testified in front of Congress in March — that the FBI could and should create its own techniques to break into phones, rather than rely on the industry that engineers them for help.In another line of questioning related to the San Bernardino case, Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., questioned the ethics of relying on a third-party to break into phones and asked if the government needed to “enhance its technological capabilities.”“We need the help of the private industry,” Cohen replied. “Both the industry that makes the technology and others. There are over 18,000 police agencies in the United States. While the FBI may have some technical ability internally, the police stations do not.”On the technical panel, Prof. Blaze of UPenn emphasized that even as the public grapples with whether government can be trusted with keys to people’s data, cryptographers don’t know how to engineer a system that offers exclusive access. In other words, if the government is able to access encrypted communications, so can sophisticated cybercriminals.“The encryption issue has been characterized as a question of whether we can build systems that allow the good guys in and keep the bad guys out,” Blaze, who has been studying encryption for over two decades, said in his opening statement. “Much of the debate has focused on questions of whether we can trust the government with keys for data. But before we can ask that question, there’s an underlying technical question, of whether we can trust the technology to actually give us a system that does that. And unfortunately, we simply don’t know how to do that safely and securely at any scale.”Blaze, alongside the rest of the technical panel, agreed that asking third-party hackers to help with government investigations was not a good policy. But he differed with law enforcement officials by saying the government should develop a solution to access data on its own.“It requires enormous resources,” Blaze said. “With the resources they currently have, I think it’s likely they don’t have the ability.” When pushed by DeGette, however, he said “I think this is a soluble problem.”At one point during the hearing, Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., expressed exasperation with the repetition of law enforcement’s statements.“I find it hard to come up with any question that is going to elicit any new answers from you,” Yarmuth said. “I think your testimony and the discussion we’ve had today is an indication of how difficult this situation is.”"
Trump has a 9/11 problem — and it’s not ‘7/11’,2910,"Donald Trump has a 9/11 problem — and it’s not that he called it “7/11” on the eve of the New York primary.At a rally in Buffalo, N.Y., Monday, the Republican frontrunner referred to the wrong date while recalling the 2001 terror attacks — a flub that was soon trending online. But it was a story about his own experience at Ground Zero that is drawing scrutiny.“Everyone who helped clear the rubble — and I was there, and I watched, and I helped a little bit — but I want to tell you: Those people were amazing,” Trump said. “Clearing the rubble. Trying to find additional lives. You didn’t know what was going to come down on all of us — and they handled it.”The real estate mogul’s anecdote was meant to illustrate his “New York values” — a phrase that has become a conservative flashpoint in Trump’s battle with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the race for the GOP nomination.Trump speaks at a rally in Buffalo, N.Y., on Monday. (Photo: Carlo Allegri/Reuters)But his assertion that he helped clear rubble in the search for 9/11 survivors is fraught with questions.“Did he mean he picked up a few chunks of concrete?” Philip Bump writes in the Washington Post. “Sent staff to assist? It’s not clear.”It’s clear that Trump was at or near Ground Zero in the days following the attacks.New York Newsday spotted Trump there on Sept. 13, according to this excerpt cited in Bump’s report:The same day, standing three blocks from Ground Zero, Trump gave an interview to a German television reporter who asked the real estate mogul whether he would be involved in the reconstruction efforts.“Well, I have a lot of men down here right now,” Trump replied. “We have over 100 and we have about 125 coming. So we’ll have a couple of hundred people down here.”But there appears to be no evidence to substantiate Trump’s claim that he helped — even “a little bit” — in the rubble removal.The Trump campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. But as the brash billionaire has already proven in this campaign, a lack of evidence doesn’t stop Trump from making claims about 9/11.While defending his call for the surveillance of “certain mosques,” Trump said he saw “thousands and thousands of people” in New Jersey cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center with his own eyes.“I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,” Trump said at rally in Birmingham, Ala., in November. “And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.”In a subsequent interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Trump doubled down.“They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down,” Trump said. “I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down — and that tells you something. It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don’t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.”While there were images of people in parts the Middle East cheering the attacks, there is no evidence that similar celebrations took place in New Jersey. But the GOP hopeful didn’t budge.“It did happen. I saw it,” Trump insisted. “It was on television.”At a rally in Columbus, Ohio, the following day, Trump made another 9/11 claim: that he witnessed people jumping out of the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan — from his luxury apartment in midtown.""Many people jumped and I witnessed it, I watched that. I have a view — a view in my apartment that was specifically aimed at the World Trade Center,” Trump said. “And I watched those people jump and I watched the second plane hit … I saw the second plane hit the building and I said, ‘Wow that’s unbelievable.’”Trump has long maintained his residence inside Trump Tower, which is located more than four miles away from Ground Zero. But he never clarified how he managed to “witness” people jumping out of the World Trade Center from his apartment.And during a GOP debate in February, Trump said he “lost hundreds of friends” in the attacks that killed 2,983 people.But the Trump campaign has refused repeated calls from the Daily Beast to name one.In his interview with the German television station, Trump said he had just come from the site, but made no mention of the friends he’s since said he lost.“I just went to what they call Ground Zero,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it. The devastation, the human life that’s been just wasted for no reason whatsoever. It’s a terrible scene. It’s a terrible sight. But New Yorkers are very strong and resilient and they’ll rebuild quickly.”On the 12th anniversary of the attacks, Trump did, however, offer some kind thoughts to his Twitter followers.“I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th,” Trump tweeted on Sept. 11, 2013.The tweet was eventually deleted."
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders battle for momentum in New York’s Democratic primary,1012,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Mary Altaffer/AP, Seth Wenig/APBROOKLYN, N.Y. — Bill Clinton starkly laid out the stakes for New York’s Democratic presidential primary at an event in the Long Island suburb of Elmont earlier this month.“Look. This election in so many ways psychologically is coming down to New York,” he said.Indeed, while Hillary Clinton has racked up enough delegates in earlier primaries to put her on a path to victory, the race in New York remains crucial to her campaign. The delegate-rich state provides the possibility of a decisive win, but also the potential for humiliation if born-and-bred New York City rival Bernie Sanders keeps the margin close in Clinton’s adopted home.SLIDESHOW – Primary day in New York >>>Polls heading into the Empire State’s election on Tuesday show Clinton poised for another victory, but with Sen. Sanders having won eight of the last nine contests, his campaign has been on a hot streak. Sanders’ team argues that this momentum will help him overtake Clinton in the delegate count as the candidates hopscotch the country, leading other delegates to switch sides come convention time.In an email sent to supporters last Wednesday, Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, laid out the importance of the New York primary.“Did you see that last week, Bernie’s campaign manager said they will ‘100 percent, absolutely’ push for a contested convention in July — even if Hillary holds on to her big lead in the popular vote? There’s only one way to stop that from happening: build an insurmountable delegate lead. To do that, we need a strong result in New York one week from today,” Mook wrote.It’s easy to see why New York is a prize for the Democratic hopefuls. With 291 delegates on the line, it is second only to California in terms of impact on the race. However, for Clinton, the state has added importance because she represented it in the U.S. Senate from 2001 until 2009 and has made it her home since she left the White House. Losing her adopted home state to Sanders, who despite his Brooklyn roots has been largely absent from New York for decades, would be an especially embarrassing defeat.The  RealClearPolitics average of New York primary polls  shows Clinton with an 11.7-point lead over Sanders. However, the polls have tightened substantially. Just last month, Clinton had an advantage of more than 30 points in New York.The Clintons sign in at their voting place in Chappaqua, N.Y., Tuesday, April 19, 2016. (Photo: Richard Drew/AP)A Clinton campaign official who requested anonymity told Yahoo News on Monday that the campaign always expected that the primary in New York would be competitive.The official also noted that the current state of the race means Sanders will  have to win more than 56 percent of the delegates  in New York, and every other state on the calendar, to overtake Clinton. Because of this, Sanders would need to do more than just outperform the polls to come out ahead: He needs to beat Clinton by several points to make a difference.Both Clinton and Sanders have strengths in the state. As he has elsewhere, Sanders has drawn massive crowds and generated substantial enthusiasm among younger voters. Along with the youth vote, Sanders’ team is hoping to win among working-class voters. Robert Becker, Sanders’ deputy national field director, told Yahoo News that the campaign’s decision to have its first major New York City event in the hardscrabble South Bronx neighborhood on March 31 was a deliberate signal about whom Sanders hopes to make part of his base.“We started out … in the South Bronx. That should have been a signal of where we’re going to make a play, the sort of lower end on the wage scale, make poverty an issue here, obviously, working class, the youth,” Becker said when asked where Sanders expected to draw support.Sanders faces strong obstacles as he tries to win with that coalition. Clinton has repeatedly outperformed him with black voters, and recent polls indicate he is not on track to buck this trend in New York.Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, who is backing Clinton, identified some of the candidates’ advantages in a conversation with Yahoo News at a campaign event in Harlem earlier this month.“I think it’s very much of a home state for her,” Brewer said of Clinton. “She was beloved in New York. Sen. Sanders hasn’t been in Brooklyn for a long time. So I think Hillary will win big. That said, in addition to being the borough president, I also teach at Hunter College and … a lot of my students, they like Bernie.”Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in Prospect Park, in Brooklyn, N.Y., where he was born. (Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP)A Quinnipiac University poll released on April 12 found that while Sanders has a 19-point lead among voters ages 18 to 44, he was trailing badly with African-American voters. Quinnipiac showed Clinton with a huge 37-point advantage among New York’s black voters, and the university’s pollsters largely attributed her overall lead to the African-American electorate.“Black voters matter for Secretary Hillary Clinton in the New York Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University Poll Assistant Director Maurice Carroll said in a statement announcing the results.The rules in New York also favor Clinton. Sanders has, thus far, fared better in states with open primaries where independents are allowed to vote in the Democratic race. However, New York election law allows only registered Democrats to participate in the primary. Voters who wanted to join the party had to do so by last October, and new voters who wanted to register as Democrats needed to do so by March 25. Because of these rules, Sanders needs to win among people who were already members of the Democratic Party and were registered before he kicked off his campaign in the state.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>In the spin room after the Democratic debate last Thursday, Sanders’ senior adviser Tad Devine acknowledged that the closed nature of New York’s primary is not ideal for his candidate. Devine also pointed out that Sanders’ strength with voters who are not party stalwarts may also be part of why he outperforms Clinton in some hypothetical general election polls. Those results are a major part of the Sanders campaign case that delegates should switch sides and back the Vermont senator.“It is an obstacle. I mean, listen, we do better when independents can vote. … It’s just a much better system, and Bernie does much better with independents,” Devine said.Clinton also has the backing of the vast majority of New York’s elected Democratic establishment. The state’s entire congressional delegation has endorsed her, along with Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. At Sanders’ South Bronx rally, Assemblyman Luis Sepúlveda suggested he faced pressure to back Clinton.“Several months ago, I was told, ‘You must endorse a particular candidate,” Sepúlveda recounted. “And I said, ‘Hold on, what’s the rush to judgment? Why don’t we find out about all the candidates? Let’s review the record.”And many of the Democratic politicians backing Clinton have strong voter turnout organizations of their own, including Brewer, Rep. Charlie Rangel, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. Speaking with Yahoo News in the spin room after the debate, Jeffries said the organization in his Brooklyn district was working the streets for Clinton.“We’re going to work as hard as we can over the next few days to turn the vote out,” Jeffries said.Clinton campaigning at Junior’s restaurant in Brooklyn with Council Member Laurie Cumbo and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Saturday, April 9, 2016. (Photo: Seth Wenig/AP)With Sanders’ momentum and the polls tightening, Clinton will need to capitalize on all of her strengths in the state. While she has begun building what some on her campaign have termed an “insurmountable” delegate lead, a narrow single-digit victory in her adopted home, with an army of allies by her side, will hardly dull Sanders’ momentum or stop his campaign from arguing that delegates should jump Clinton’s ship. In the spin room, Devine argued that Sanders doesn’t necessarily need a victory in New York to remain viable.“Listen, I’m not going to say we’re going to win every contest between now and the middle of June. We’re going to win most of them. We’re going to win, by far, most of the delegates. We can make up the pledged delegate differential,” Devine said. “I believe when the voting’s over, he’ll be ahead in pledged delegates, he’ll be way ahead in the general election matchups, and I think the Democratic Party is going to … realize that Bernie Sanders, by far, is the strongest candidate for our party.”"

(Photos: John Minchillo/AP; Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx/AP; Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)They may be the frontrunners, but a majority of Americans can’t see themselves supporting either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Nor, for that matter, could they fathom supporting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll, 68 percent of registered voters say they couldn’t see themselves supporting Trump, while 58 percent say the same about Clinton. Sixty-one percent of voters surveyed said they couldn’t see themselves backing Cruz.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>Bernie Sanders and John Kasich fared slightly better, with a minority of voters saying they couldn’t see themselves supporting either the Vermont senator (48 percent) or the Ohio governor (47 percent). What’s more, 65 percent of all voters hold a negative view of Trump — making him “the most unpopular major presidential candidate in the history” of the NBC/WSJ poll. A majority of voters (56 percent) have an unfavorable view of Clinton — a figure that has risen five points in the last month — while 49 percent view Cruz the same way.In terms of favorability, Sanders and Kasich scored net-positive favorability ratings, the NBC/WSJ poll found. Sanders is also the only candidate who more voters could see themselves supporting than could not.“To top it off,” NBC senior political editor Mark Murray noted, “just 19 percent of all respondents give Clinton high marks for being honest and trustworthy, while only 12 percent give Trump high scores for having the right temperament.”Nonetheless, a majority of likely voters in both parties say they’d be satisfied with them as their nominees.Among Democrats, 73 percent say they’d be either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with Clinton as the nominee, while 63 percent of Republicans said the same about Trump.Still, more GOP voters say they’d be satisfied with Cruz (66 percent) than with Trump.New York Rep. Peter King is not one of them.“I hate Ted Cruz,” King said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday. “I think I’ll take cyanide if he got the nomination.”"
"Trump and the NY ‘establishment’: If you can’t join ’em, beat ’em",426,"Donald Trump speaks to supporters on April 17 in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. (Photo: Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)NEW YORK—Donald Trump was having a moment.Dressed in a tuxedo jacket and bow tie, the real estate mogul and former reality television star took the stage at last week’s New York State Republican Gala as the unlikely frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination. But in a ballroom at the Grand Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan, the real estate project that put him on the Manhattan map in 1980, Trump devoted less than half his speech to politics — declaring the subject to sometimes be “a little boring.”Instead, as he scanned the crowd of nearly 1,000 Republican donors and party officials, including many from the Manhattan social orbit he’d been circling just outside of for decades, Trump sought a different kind of validation: one focusing on his business achievements. “I built this hotel,” he declared, motioning to the room around him. “Everybody said, don’t do it. It can’t be done. It’s never going to happen. Bad area. Bad location. Tremendous crime. The city is dying. And the city was dying. It wasn’t just like not doing well. The city was dead.” Even his beloved father, a real estate developer who was his mentor, told him, “Don’t do it. Don’t do it,” Trump recalled. But he followed his gut. Trump ran out unsavory tenants and ignored critics who mocked his glassy redesign of the decrepit Commodore Hotel adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. And to improve the hotel’s image, he tweaked the address, changing the building’s location to tony Park Avenue — even though it technically fronts East 42nd Street. “It’s on the Park Avenue ramp, in all fairness, right?” Trump explained with a shrug.The Grand Hyatt was Trump’s first big success, the project that launched his career as a major player in Manhattan real estate and beyond. And now here he was, back inside the building where it had all began, this time commanding an even grander stage as an insurgent presidential candidate close to capturing his party’s nomination. But instead of enjoying the moment, Trump seemed consumed with something that has dominated much of his life: Trying to win respect from a hometown crowd that has always seemed to look down on him.Long before Trump was bickering with Republican party officials desperate to block him from winning the party’s 2016 presidential nomination, he was at war with the “establishment” of New York — including fellow businessmen and members of Manhattan society who viewed the developer and reality TV star, born and raised across the river in Queens, as a tacky, vulgar outsider whose only qualification was his bank account.Because of that, the New York GOP primary has taken on particular significance to Trump. It’s not just his quest to get to the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, and it’s more than just a getting a home-state victory. For Trump, who came into Tuesday with a more-than-20-point lead in the primary according to several polls, winning New York is personal, a chance to perhaps finally get some bit of the respect he has been seeking most of his life.Publicly, Trump has professed not to care that much what critics say about him. But in his books and interviews dating back nearly 40 years, the real estate mogul has long has a chip on his shoulder about “the establishment” looking down on him. The tone of many of these pieces echoes the increasingly ugly back-and-forth between Trump and members of the Republican Party who believe his candidacy could sink the party if he wins the nomination.In an interview with New York Magazine in 1980, Trump openly complained about being viewed as a joke by other real estate developers, pointing to his Grand Hyatt project and Trump Tower, which was then under construction. At the time, he had demolished a series of Art Deco sculptures that had been a part of the original building on the Trump Tower site, enraging landmarks groups who had fought to save them. The controversy also alienated New York’s well-to-do who didn’t like Trump’s brash flamboyance.Asked about the controversy by Vanity Fair in 1990, Trump raged. “I’ll never have the goodwill of the establishment, the tastemakers of New York,” he     declared at the time. “Do you think, if I failed, these guys in New York would be unhappy? They would be thrilled! Because they have never tried anything on the scale that I am trying things in this city. I don’t care about their goodwill.”And in his books, he repeatedly relishes the moments he bested a rival or critic who predicted he would fail and lashes out at the people he believed were his friends who turned their backs on him. “During the bad times, I learned who was loyal and who wasn’t,” Trump wrote in his 1997 book “The Art of the Comeback.” “I believe in an eye for an eye. A couple of people who betrayed me need my help now, and I am screwing them against the wall … and I am having so much fun.”That same year, Trump told New York Magazine of his critics, “They do not know how smart I am. … (The social people) all kiss your ass if you’re hot, and they’re kissing hard now.”Donald Trump poses with New York State Republican Committee chairman Ed Cox during a party gala on April 14 in New York City. (Photo: Kathy Willens/AP)In some ways, Trump’s early comments foreshadow his descriptions of establishment Republicans who, he claims, are finally coming around to his campaign. In recent weeks, as he solidified his status as the man to beat in the GOP race, Trump bragged to reporters that Republican leaders were now calling him — although some of them, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, a not-so-subtle Trump critic, phoned the real estate mogul “at his request,” as a Ryan aide put it.Trump’s nearly lifelong battle against the “establishment” seems like a rehearsal for his current role as a candidate with many grievances, most recently including his criticism of what he has said is a “corrupt” party delegate system that is “rigged” against his campaign because the party doesn’t want an outsider like him to come in and shake things up.“How have we gotten to the point where politicians defend a rigged delegate-selection process with more passion than they have ever defended America’s borders?” Trump wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published last week. “Perhaps it is because politicians care more about securing their private club than about securing their country.”But Trump has claimed some small victories. As he wrapped up his remarks at the Republican dinner last week, Ed Cox, chairman of the state GOP committee, followed him on stage. Cox, a frequent critic of Trump’s presidential campaign, said last year there was no way Trump could win the nomination because he wasn’t part of the “Republican brand.”But now on stage with Trump, Cox was far more conciliatory, describing Trump as a political “genius” who is a the “frontrunner for our party’s nomination.”Behind him, Trump, who was already shaking hands with supporters as he left he stage, paused and grinned."
Clinton trips up in the Big Apple. New Yorkers can relate.,692,"Clinton, attempting to use the subway. (Photo: Yana Paskova/Getty Images.)Earlier this month, a little more than two weeks before New York’s Tuesday primary, Hillary Clinton decided to take the subway.It did not go smoothly.Attempting to go through a turnstile at the 161st Street station in the Bronx, the former secretary of state had to swipe her fare card no less than five times as camera phones flashed and one local seemed to grow impatient standing behind her. After cramming a posse of aides into an already crowded No. 4 train car for a one-stop trip, she then attempted to engage with a young woman in headphones who seemed categorically unimpressed.Almost immediately, Clinton’s critics cited the incident as an example of how out of touch she was. “You can tell Hillary hasn’t done the subway in a while, since she’s talking to people,” Chuck Ross, a reporter at the Daily Caller, tweeted, acknowleding an unspoken rule of silence among New York commuters. Former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., offered an instructional video, swiping her MetroCard once and walking through a turnstile before declaring, “It’s just that easy, just that quick.”But as Clinton hops around the state she once represented in the Senate and still calls home, her awkward encounters with some of its biggest  institutions and most powerful inhabitants have also struck a chord of sympathy with New Yorkers. Turning up your nose at, say, a fried Oreo at the Iowa State fair is far worse than screwing up a subway swipe. The rules of campaigning morph from state to state. And in a city full of transplants, Clinton’s typically awkward interactions have come across as surprisingly charming reminders of what it means to survive the daily New York schlep. As the New York Times so elegantly judged the subway incident: “At least Mrs. Clinton tried.”Clinton at Junior’s in Brooklyn. (Photo: Seth Wenig/AP.)And try she has. Not long after her fight with the turnstile, the former New York senator visited Junior’s, a diner in downtown Brooklyn, where she and her entourage were presented with a choice of the iconic spot’s classics: pineapple or strawberry cheesecakes. She eyed the dense, creamy slices hungrily, but refused to take a bite. “I learned early on not to eat in front of all of you,” she said, addressing the massed ranks of camera operators around her. New Yorkers who would only ever eat Junior’s cheesecake alone in their kitchen with the blinds drawn could relate. The incident inspired a jokey BuzzFeed post titled “ Hillary Clinton vs. Cheesecake.” Jessica Roy, a news editor at New York magazine, shared one particularly painful image that showed Clinton pursing her lips, peering longingly at the strawberry slice. “Hillary has never been more relatable than she is in this pic,” she tweeted.Perhaps the most engaging moment in Clinton’s city expedition came during a tour she took of a New York City Housing Authority property in East Harlem. As she walked through the Corsi Houses, a seniors-only building that has been plagued with mold and water damage, reporters snapped photos of her shocked expressions. Josh Robin, a reporter for news channel NY1, caught one particularly powerful moment as the presidential candidate gazed at a narrow kitchen the width of a hallway — an image that swiftly inspired memes on Twitter. Some of the reactions were along the predictable lines of “Woman who gives speeches for $225,000 sees how the rest of the world lives,” but others understood her horrified expression in the context of New York City apartment life.“That’s a classic ‘You pay $3,000 a month for this?’ face,” one follower observed, a response that was retweeted more than 450 times. Brett LoGiurato, a deputy editor at Business Insider, shared the photo, with the caption, “When your mom sees your NYC apartment for the first time.”Like anyone’s visit to New York City, Senator Clinton’s has not been without its obvious lows. Even someone with a PR team as large hers, for instance, couldn’t avoid walking under the gray cloud of negative media coverage that follows New York Mayor Bill de Blasio around — especially after participating in an unfortunate skit that that involved a joke about “CP time” (colored-people time). And then there was that rally where Bill Clinton mocked Bernie Sanders’ supporters, joking at a Fort Washington event that the Vermont senator’s message was to “just shoot every third person on Wall Street and everything will be fine.” On Monday, she told reporters that she carries hot sauce in her bag, which is most likely just something she heard in a Beyoncé song. But hey, even the most successful Fifth Avenue resident sometimes steps in a pile of dog poop. A New York residency, however brief, is not complete without a little bit of abject failure.However well or poorly she does in the primary election, at least a few people on Clinton’s campaign seem to have understood that looking vulnerable in the city can work to her advantage. Just a few days after Clinton’s run-in with the MTA, the error page for her website changed stealthily one night. “Trying to get where you want to go?” it read, below a GIF of Clinton swiping over and over again. “This page isn’t it.”"
"Meet Trump's maxed-out donors, believers in the cause",65,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Letantia Bussell, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, says she appreciates Donald Trump's ""unique personality."" Peter Zieve, an engineer in Washington, loves Trump because ""the guy's a person, not a robot."" Daniel Arias, an El Salvadoran immigrant in Florida, is positive Trump will put an end to newcomers ""coming here and begging for food stamps.""They are the few, the proud, the maxed-out Trump donors.The leader of the Republican presidential contest ridicules donors and insists he is a billionaire who wants to ""self-fund."" Yet there's a prominent ""donate"" button on his campaign website, and he has raised more than $9.5 million, including from about 200 people who have given $2,700, the maximum allowed by law for the primary election.Because it's such a relatively small sample — a tiny sliver compared with Hillary Clinton's nearly 29,000 maxed-out donors — it's impossible to reach broad conclusions about Trump's benefactors. Still, these are arguably the most loyal of Trump fans, and their interviews with The Associated Press reveal unexpected layers of the political newcomer's appeal.They're both attracted and repelled by Trump's inflammatory comments. Just like the thousands who attend Trump's massive rallies, these well-off fans want dramatic change and see Trump as the only person capable of making it happen. And far from being embarrassed by their candidate, the donors seem to love converting their friends and associates to the cause.___HELP NOT WANTEDFirst things first: Why did the donors decide to give to a candidate who belittles them? Trump recently said of his campaign donors' help, ""Whatever. It's peanuts.""Bussell didn't set out to give the candidate money. She wanted to write him a letter of encouragement in August. But when she saw the donate option on his web page, she decided financial help was a better way to show support.Donating is taking action. And just as Phillip Braunstein likes politicians who ""walk the walk, not only talk the talk,"" he felt compelled to do more than just say he likes Trump. That's why the 33-year-old Los Angeles real estate business owner laid down his $2,700 in October.__WHO'S GIVINGThe list of maxed-out donors includes some characters. Literally. There's Alice Chapman, a reality television star and the wife of Dog the Bounty Hunter. There's Jim Shore, a well-known artist who sells his figurines on QVC. Kelly Roberts has also chipped in. She's the mother of two ""television personalities,"" wife of a millionaire frozen-burrito king and co-owner of the historic Mission Inn Hotel and Spa in Riverside, California.Most people who part ways with several thousand dollars are on firm financial footing. Some of Trump's donors are downright rich. John Ferolito, who co-founded AriZona iced tea, gave in July. And Scott Shleifer, head of the multi-billion-dollar New York hedge fund Tiger Global, ponied up $2,700 last year, a few months before he purchased an $18 million Park Avenue condo.The AP culled the names of Trump's top donors from his public Federal Election Commission filings, which are complete through the end of February. More contributors will emerge on Wednesday, when he files his March fundraising documents.___WHAT THEY LIKEIt's all about immigration for Arias, himself an immigrant.The 75-year-old real estate investor in Coconut Grove said he came to the country legally, thanks to sisters already here and visas that made it easier for family members to emigrate, some 30 years ago.""He's the only one who is going to do something to stop illegal immigration,"" said Arias, who contends many come here for the government benefits and ""to steal and sell drugs."" Trump famously kicked off his campaign by saying some Mexican immigrants who entered the country illegally are ""rapists.""Arias is far from alone in parroting Trump's saltier language and buzz words. More than one said they like Trump because they think he will make America great again, which happens to be his slogan, emblazoned on red ball caps.Al Gamble, a Connecticut restaurant owner, said he gave to Trump in October because he is tired of families like the Bushes and the Clintons, who have ""raped this country to assist in the globalist's agenda.""___LIKE CANDIDATE, LIKE DONORAnd some of the donors seem to have adopted Trump's tone on his opponents.""I think Trump has the best chance of winning, and I only back winners,"" Braunstein said. He liked Marco Rubio and others, but asked himself, ""why would I spend my money on a loser?""Many who spoke with AP said they could do without some of Trump's incendiary rhetoric but didn't hold that against him.""I love the Trump ideas,"" Gamble said. ""The way he delivers that message is terrible.""Zieve, an engineer who said he conducts business around the world and is a longtime Republican Party donor, said he's ""not proud of some the silly stuff he's said."" He cited Trump's recent assertion that if abortions are outlawed, the women who have them should be punished (Trump quickly walked that back).""Sometimes I wish he would put a zipper on it,"" Zieve said.At the same time, that no-holds-barred approach has kept him riveted — and supportive. Zieve gave $2,700 at the end of February.""Every time something comes out of his mouth, it's exactly something that would come out of my mouth,"" he said. One example: When Mexican leaders dismissed Trump's demand that they pay for his proposed border wall, Trump declared the wall ""just got 10 feet higher.""""Bingo! That's the right answer. I love that guy!"" Zieve said. His bottom line on Trump sounds a lot like something Trump would say: ""We are getting screwed around the world because we don't have a leader. He is a leader.""___WINNING OVER OTHERSBussell, the dermatologist, said she gave because she likes Trump, though she hasn't met him. She's from New Jersey and said she spends lots of time explaining to her West Coast friends — and Beverly Hills patients — that Trump has ""a certain sense of humor"" and doesn't precisely mean everything he says.""He's refreshing. He has an incredible loyalty to our country and a strong desire to see the people of our country do well and be happy,"" she said. ""We don't need more of the same. We need a change. It's as if the country is in need of a significant oil change and he is the best mechanic.""Richard Worthington, who is in Las Vegas real estate development and describes himself as a ""bleeding-heart conservative,"" said he readily engages friends on Trump — and often finds they end up liking him. Trump's plain talk about trade deals being bad for the U.S. is a big point of agreement, he said. ""Even my liberal girlfriend actually likes him,"" he said. ""She's from New York.""Zieve insisted the support for Trump is broader than people think: ""I work with a lot of bright people. And the brightest are all for Trump.""Public opinion surveys throw a bit of cold water on his theory. Seven in 10 Americans, including close to half of Republican voters, have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to an AP-Gfk poll this month.___PERSONAL TIESThe first person to donate $2,700 to Trump's presidential bid, weeks before he even glided down the escalator in his New York tower and declared his candidacy, was Pamela Newman, a friend and a longtime insurance provider for Trump's business.The campaign has been good to her, as well: Between June and February, it paid the branch of Aon Risk Services where she works almost $300,000.Yet not all of those who know Trump and gave him money are doing so for the usual reasons.Joe Kaminkow, a well-known game developer, met Trump years ago when designing a slot-machine version of ""The Apprentice,"" Trump's hit TV show.""From my one-on-one dealings with him, he's a gentleman,"" Kaminkow said. He thinks Trump is right about some policy issues, too, such as making trade deals more favorable to the U.S. ""But the question is, who do you want answering the call at 3 a.m.? I think we need a president who maintains our stability and strength with understanding. And he isn't behaving in that way.""So why the heck did Kaminkow give Trump $2,700 in August?""Well, I'm a Democrat, and I feel like Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person in the race,"" he said. ""But I was so entertained by what I saw from the Republicans on TV that I wanted to do my part to keep that party going.""___Associated Press writer Chad Day contributed to this report.___Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz"
Supreme Court asks whether Obama overreached with immigration program,984,"President Obama announces his expansive executive actions on immigration in 2014. (Photo: Jim Bourg, Pool/AP)The Supreme Court’s conservatives, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, seemed skeptical Monday of President Obama’s sweeping immigration executive actions that would shield 4.5 million unauthorized immigrants from deportation and make them eligible for work permits.Two lower courts ruled that the “deferred action” programs were unconstitutional, and prevented them from being implemented pending the Supreme Court’s decision. The court, which lost its conservative firebrand Antonin Scalia in February, has been mostly kind to the president’s legacy — but it’s unclear if his luck will hold out in his final year in office.In oral arguments in the case, Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli to explain whether he believed a president could decide not to deport any immigrants at all. Verrilli said immigration law binds the executive to deport immigrants recently arrived at the border and those who commit crimes, but he stressed that Obama’s program, which is aimed at young unauthorized immigrants and the parents of U.S. citizens, is not that sweeping. “That’s a million miles from where we are now,” Verrilli said.“It’s 4 million people from where we are now,” interrupted Justice Anthony Kennedy, one of the court’s conservatives who occasionally sides with the liberals. Kennedy added that he thinks the president is setting policy on his own, ignoring the will of Congress. “That’s just upside down,” he protested.Both Roberts and Kennedy sided with the court’s liberals in the last major immigration case to reach the Supreme Court, over Arizona’s SB 1070 law. They affirmed the executive’s power to pursue its own immigration policies even when it inconveniences states.But in Monday’s oral argument, both men asked questions that suggested they believe this case is different. If the court rules against the government, it could put in jeopardy Obama’s earlier program that has already protected from deportation 800,000 young unauthorized immigrants who came to the country as children. That deferred action program is not being challenged, but if the court issues a broad ruling, it may undercut its status as well.SLIDESHOW – Pro-immigration activists rally at the Supreme Court >>>Mario Gochez of New Jersey joins other supporters of immigration reform in front of the Supreme Court, April 18, 2016. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)Verrilli maintained that Texas and 25 other states that joined its claim do not have the legal right, or standing, to sue the federal government. Texas is suing because the state allows people with deferred action status to apply for driver’s licenses. The state estimates it would spend millions of dollars if the estimated 500,000 people in its state who will be legalized under Obama’s programs apply for licenses.The government says Texas could easily change its law, preventing people on deferred action from getting licenses. But Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito seemed to reject that argument, pointing out the government would probably sue Texas if it blocked immigrants from accessing licenses. Verrilli would not rule out that possibility, but maintained the state still did not have standing.Justice Stephen Breyer made the most convincing argument for not granting Texas standing — a decision that would allow the eight-person court to dodge a contentious deadlock on a politically charged case. The liberal judge said the Supreme Court had already decided that states and taxpayers may not bring suits against the federal government simply because they do not believe their taxpayer money should be spent on policies they do not agree with. Allowing such suits to continue would make courts the referees in non-Constitutional disputes between states and the feds. “Before you know it, power will be transferred from the president and Congress, where it belongs, to a group of unelected judges,” Breyer said.It’s unclear whether Breyer’s argument will sway his colleagues. In 2007, the court’s liberals allowed Massachusetts’ residents to sue the Environmental Protection Agency over its failure to enforce carbon emissions rules, which they argued was leading to the erosion of the state’s coastline. Breyer argued that case was different, because it involved the state’s land, not simply its taxpayer funds. At one point on Monday, Roberts said that the loss of the state’s money is “classic” injury, suggesting he may not share Breyer’s hesitation on standing.It’s not just the fate of millions of immigrants that hang in the balance. If the court strikes down the president’s immigration actions, it will be a reversal of recent trends. “Historically, immigration is an area where the Supreme Court has given the president a whole lot of deference,” said Jeff Rosen, president of the nonprofit National Constitution Center. If the court decides Obama overreached, “that will be a really dramatic holding.”A decision is expected in June."
Bernie Sanders blasts critics who call his ideas unrealistic: ‘Nothing is radical’,2880,"Bernie Sanders addresses supporters at a massive rally on Sunday in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Fresh from a whirlwind weekend in which he met the pope and drew his largest-ever crowd at a rally in Brooklyn, Bernie Sanders hit back against a theme that’s become central to Hillary Clinton’s campaign: He has some great ideas, but when it comes to getting them done, his plans are — as Larry David put it on “Saturday Night Live” — nothing more than “yada, yada, yada.”On CNN’s “New Day” Monday, one day before New York’s primary, Sanders pointed out that he called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.50 more than five years ago.“Most people thought that was a crazy idea,” the Vermont senator said. “Well, guess what. California, New York, Oregon have done it. Why? Because people stood up and fought.”Sanders said the same about same-sex marriage.“Ten years ago, would you have believed that gay marriage would be legal in all 50 states? Probably not,“ he said. “When people stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to end bigotry in America — people have a right to love whomever,’ change takes place.”At a block party in Washington Heights Sunday, Clinton pushed her pragmatic message.“It’s easy to diagnose the problem,” the Democratic frontrunner said. “You’ve got to be able to solve the problem.”The Vermont senator, though, dismissed her criticism, saying his “radical ideas” are anything but.“I believe everything we’re talking about,” Sanders said. “Nothing is radical. These ideas have existed in other countries. They’ve existed in the United States.”SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>His comments come on the eve of the Democratic primary in New York, where polls show Clinton with a comfortable, double-digit lead over Sanders in her adopted home state.The Brooklyn-born Sanders urged an estimated 28,000 at his rally in Prospect Park Sunday to help him overcome her edge.“When I was a kid growing up in Flatbush, our parents would take us to Prospect Park,” he said. “But I was never here speaking to 20,000 people. This is a campaign that’s on the move. This is a campaign that one year ago was considered a fringe candidacy — 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. Well they don’t consider us fringe anymore.”“This is a movement of people who are prepared to think big, not small,” Sanders added. “People who want to elect not just the new president, but to transform America.”"
"Unconventional #3: The return of the dark-horse nominee, why Trump is ‘out of his mind’ (and more!)",153,"Paul Ryan, Wendell Willkie, John W. Davis and Adlai Stevenson. (Photos: Scott Applewhite/AP, AP, BHR/AP, AP)Unconventional is Yahoo News’ complete guide to what could be the craziest presidential convention — or conventions — in decades. Here’s what you need to know today.Last Tuesday House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., summoned reporters to a press conference in Washington, D.C., to address the speculation that he might swoop in and save the Republican Party from certain suicide next November by allowing a deadlocked convention in Cleveland to bypass the gentlemen who are actually running for the job and nominate him for president instead.“Let me be clear: I do not want nor will I accept the nomination of our party,” Ryan declared. “I should not be considered. Period. End of story.”Ryan went on to instruct delegates “to only choose a person who has actually participated in the primary.” He even advocated for a rule change to that effect.“I think it would be wrong to go any other way,” Ryan concluded.To hear Ryan tell it, the very notion of a white knight — that is, any noncandidate turned nominee at the eleventh hour, whether or not he answers to the name “Paul Ryan” — represents an unspeakable abomination with potentially apocalyptic consequences for a party that is already in open revolt against the so-called establishment. Many Republicans seem to agree.But history says otherwise.Looking back, Ryanesque candidates aren’t particularly rare. They even have a name: dark horses. In the 19th century, when bosses and delegates picked nominees without any input from rank-and-file voters — there were no primaries or caucuses yet — dark horses were a normal part of the process. The first was James K. Polk, an obscure Democratic congressman whose name surfaced, seemingly out of nowhere, after frontrunner and former President Martin Van Buren failed to vanquish his chief rival on the first eight ballots of the 1844 convention; Polk, who was at home in Tennessee, wouldn’t find out until a week later that he had been nominated. A parade of dark horses followed, and many of them, like Polk, went on to become president: Franklin Pierce in 1852, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, James A. Garfield in 1880. Oh, and some guy named Abraham Lincoln.Dark horses kept rearing their heads even after primaries entered the equation in 1912. Woodrow Wilson, who emerged as the nominee at that year’s Democratic convention, wasn’t quite a dark horse, even if he trailed frontrunner Champ Clark of Missouri for the first 29 ballots and didn’t clinch the nod until ballot 46; same goes for James M. Cox of Ohio, who won on the 44th ballot eight years later. The Democratic Party’s 1924 nominee, however — a West Virginian named John W. Davis — was definitely a dark horse, having received the nomination only as a compromise on the record-setting 103rd ballot after neither of the two leading contenders was able to secure the necessary two-thirds majority during the first 102 rounds of voting. Before that Davis had “ frankly said … that he was not seeking [the nomination] and that if nominated he would accept only as a matter of public duty. ” The Democratic Party’s 1952 nominee, Adlai Stevenson, expressed similar sentiments heading into that year’s convention in Chicago. But then he gave a witty and stirring welcoming address to the delegates, and the rest is history; the party, deeply divided between its Northern and Southern factions, abandoned its leading primary candidate, Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, and turned to the intellectual from Illinois instead.The GOP nominated its fair share of dark horses during this period as well. The party’s 1916 nominee, Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes, didn’t run in the primaries. In 1920, General Leonard Wood, Illinois Gov. Frank Lowden and California Sen. Hiram Johnson were the favorites at the start of the convention, but Ohio Sen. Warren G. Harding, who’d received a mere 65.5 votes on the first ballot, wound up winning nine ballots later because he was the only candidate both progressives and conservatives could tolerate. And in 1940, Republicans chose the darkest horse of all: a Wall Street industrialist named Wendell Willkie who’d been a Democrat until 1939 and had never run for office before. Earlier that year, New York District Attorney Thomas Dewey won five primaries with 1.6 million votes. Willkie didn’t bother to enter a single contest.At this point, fans of Paul Ryan’s decision to pull a Sherman will note that primaries play a much greater role in today’s nominating process than they did in, say, 1940, when they were basically just for show. These people would be correct. The modern primary system — a series of statewide popular votes that all but determine how many delegates each candidate controls heading into the convention — only came into effect in the early 1970s, and since then dark horses have become an endangered species. Pundits have described Jimmy Carter as a dark horse, for instance, but that’s just because he wasn’t a household name when he launched his bid for the 1976 Democratic nomination; by the time the convention opened that summer he’d won 40 percent of the popular vote and pocketed more than enough delegates to clinch the nomination. Every Democratic and Republican nominee since 1972 has competed in his party’s primaries (and finished the process in first place).Presumably Ryan and fans would cite this fact as justification for his decision. It isn’t 1952 anymore, they might argue. To select a dark horse now, in 2016, would violate decades of precedent and subvert a system that has become all about the will of the people.But anyone who agrees with that statement is forgetting one important detail: We haven’t had a truly contested convention — that is, a convention with more than one round of balloting — in the modern primary era, either.In fact, we haven’t had one since 1952.Anyone who claims to know how the process will unfold — especially if they’re claiming it won’t unfold like it has in the past — is lying. If Donald Trump doesn’t hit the magic 1,237-delegate mark on the first ballot in Cleveland, and if Ted Cruz’s sleeper delegates don’t give him a majority on the second, third or 15th ballot, it’s entirely possible — even likely, given today’s polarized political atmosphere, saturation media coverage and lack of trust in party poobahs, who might have swayed delegates in the past — that both sides will dig in and that round after round of balloting will result in deadlock. In that case, it won’t really matter how much more democratic the road to the convention has become in recent years: Cleveland itself would look a lot more like 1924 than 2004, and a dark horse could be the only way out.Regardless of what Paul Ryan says. Drop me a line on Twitter (@andrewromano) and let me know if you think the GOP should consider a dark-horse nominee — and who their best dark horse would be. _____If you’ve been paying attention, then you know that the magic word for 2016 is “delegates.” It’s clear that delegates hold the keys to the kingdom … or in this case, the White House.

They’ve never really mattered since the primary season was opened up in 1972. Why do they matter now? Elaine Kamarck: The only reason they matter is because the voters haven’t given a clear-cut victory to someone. What we are accustomed to is someone wins early, they keep on winning, the other candidates drop out and by the time you get to July, there isn’t a contest anymore. Whenever the voters don’t make a clear decision, the decision-making falls to the delegates and you have essentially the system that existed prior to 1972, where party insiders get to make the decision. There’s nothing new about this. It’s just that in the modern situation we’re not used to it.It happened all the time pre-’72.The first nominating convention was in 1832. Until 1968, Americans nominated their presidents in almost exactly the same way. It was party leaders, elected as delegates in their states, going to the convention. For all that time, almost no one ran in primaries. There were very few. In fact, running in a primary was considered a weakness, not a mark of strength. In ’72, because of party rules reform efforts on the Democratic side, more states held primaries; those primaries suddenly were binding — or attempted to be— on the delegates.What do you think of Trump’s complaint that the system is corrupt and unfair?Trump’s out of his f***ing mind. Every single presidential candidate except for him knows what this system is. It’s not corrupt. It’s the system by which the parties pick their nominee. Parties are protected under the First Amendment’s freedom of assembly. No American is forced to participate.Parties are institutions. They have an interest in preserving their brand. Coca-Cola doesn’t let Pepsi participate in their brand. Republicans don’t let Democrats participate in their brand. This is a party decision, and parties make these decisions based on their institutional health. Meaning if you put someone at the top of the ticket that is so unpopular that you lose the House of Representatives, you’re not doing the right thing for your party.The voters have been included to keep parties from getting really out of touch. In 1968 Democrats did not understand the depths of the antiwar sentiment in their party and cut [Vietnam war opponents] out of their convention. This time the Republican Party didn’t understand the anger of voters for Trump. But the bottom line is, this is not a public decision — it’s a party decision.Do you want that on the record, that Trump is out of his f***ing mind? Yes. He’s out of his f***ing mind. He’s an a**hole. No other candidate has ever run for president so unprepared.Do you think his arguments will influence the way we choose nominees? The systems will only change if the parties themselves decide to change them. My guess is the system will move in the other direction from where Trump wants it to, with parties taking greater control of the nominations to keep them from being captured by people who sully the brand. Is Trump right? Should the parties do away with the delegate system and select their nominees by popular vote instead? Let us know on Facebook. _____ RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.(Photo illustration: Yahoo News, photos: Jason Reed/Reuters, AP (2))For convention nerds like you and me — OK, maybe just me — this week will be all about the RNC Spring Meeting in Hollywood. Sounds sexy, right? In normal election year, it wouldn’t be. First of all, the Hollywood we’re talking about is in Florida, not California. Plus, the big story is all about the GOP’s Rules Committee. Zzzzz.Here’s the thing, though: 2016 isn’t a normal election year. With Donald Trump  quacking Sunday about the Republican Party’s “corrupt and crooked” delegate-selection system  — and bragging about how he could buy delegates by “put[ting] them in the best planes and bring[ing] them to the best resorts anywhere in the world” — the controversy over process is about to take center stage as RNC brass gathers in the Sunshine State to consider what kind of recommendations (if any) it wants to make about the rules governing the party’s convention in Cleveland this summer.On one side of the clash are an Republican National Committee member from Oregon named Solomon Yue and Rules Committee Chairman Bruce Ash, both of whom are arguing that in Florida this week the RNC should consider a proposal to switch the rule book governing the convention from the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, which have been used at Republican National Conventions for decades, to Robert’s Rules of Order, which are common in civic and organizational meetings.On the other side are RNC Chair Reince Priebus and his allies, who are trying to scuttle the proposal. “I don’t think that it’s a good idea for us next week, I mean, before the convention, to make serious rules changes or recommendations of changes,” Priebus said Sunday on CNN. This all sounds arcane, and again, in a normal election year it would be. But switching the rule book could mean the difference between a convention where delegates can nominate a dark-horse candidate (which is possible under the current House rules) and a convention where only current candidates — Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich — could be considered (which is the likely result if Robert’s rules are adopted).So, yeah — a pretty big deal. Stay tuned for more throughout the week.–––––_____ Hubert H. Humphrey is flanked by state standards as he acknowledges the cheers of Democratic National Convention delegates who chose him to be their presidential candidate in Chicago, Aug. 30, 1968. (Photo: AP)The last major-party presidential nominee not to compete in the primaries? Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who won the Democratic nomination in 1968. Humphrey announced his candidacy on April 27, 1968, shortly after incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson withdrew from the race. It was too late for Humphrey to enter any primary contests. Still, Humphrey wasn’t a dark-horse candidate. Favorite-son surrogates competed in various primaries in his stead; meanwhile, Humphrey openly gathered support from Democratic officeholders in nonprimary states. By the time the convention in Chicago began, Humphrey’s main rival, Robert F. Kennedy, had been assassinated and Humphrey controlled more than enough delegates to clinch the nomination — which he did on the first ballot (despite a late challenge from antiwar Sen. George McGovern, a true dark horse.)_____For the latest data, make sure to check the Yahoo News  delegate scorecard and primary calendar._____"
"A party primary ‘is not a public decision,’ rules expert says",5138,"Members of the Democratic National Committee Rules and Bylaws Committee, from left, Donna Brazile, Elaine Kamarck and Alice Germond vote on what to do with Florida delegates during their meeting in Washington in 2008. (Photo: LM Otero/AP)Elaine Kamarck got her start in Democratic politics in the 1970s, at a time when political parties had just recently begun to open up the presidential nominating process. The modern primary system did not really even exist until that decade, after a set of party reforms following the 1968 election took control of the nominating process out of the hands of party insiders and allowed voters a greater say.The current controversy over the Republican Party’s nominating process, driven by Donald Trump’s complaints that the system is “rigged” and “corrupt” — and his call for a “bold infusion of popular will” — ignores the fact that the rules have been generally the same for more than four decades. Kamarck, who started as an aide to President Jimmy Carter and became a top White House official during the Clinton administration in the ’90s, wrote a book called Primary Politics (2009), which explains the history of how the modern nominating process for Republicans and Democrats came to be.She talked to Yahoo News about the current debate over the GOP system. The transcript of the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.Yahoo News: A lot of people are wondering about these rules for how delegates are selected. They’ve never really mattered since the primary season was opened up in 1972. Why is that?Elaine Kamarck: They’ve mattered three times. They mattered for the Democrats in 1972. They mattered for the Republicans in 1976. And they mattered for the Democrats in 1980.But for most people under 30, that’s ancient history.True. Most people are accustomed to thinking that — if they think about those delegates at all — they think those are people brought to the convention to cheer on the nominee and wear stupid hats.So why does it matter now?The only reason it matters is because the voters haven’t given a clear-cut victory to someone. What we are accustomed to is: Someone wins early, they keep on winning, the other candidates drop out, and by the time you get to July, there isn’t a contest anymore. Whenever the voters don’t make a clear decision, the decision making falls to the delegates and you have essentially the system that existed prior to 1972, where party insiders get to make the decision. There’s nothing new about this. It’s just that in the modern situation, we’re not used to it.It happened all the time pre-1972.The first nominating convention was in 1832.

My guess is the system will move in the other direction from where Trump wants it to, with parties taking greater control of the nominations to keep them from being captured by people who sully the brand.Trump is essentially arguing for direct democracy.Exactly. He is arguing [for] direct democracy. The Congress has considered a national primary many times. Political parties, however, will never be for it. The current system is very open through the primaries and caucuses and to letting new people participate. At the same time, it has an insider piece to it. That’s why the system has persisted for 40-some years.The general election is a different story because it’s a constitutionally sanctioned thing. The parties are a different thing. Parties have the right to say this person is not a Democrat or a Republican. They are voluntary associations of citizens. They are semipublic organizations. No democracy has ever managed to function without parties. They are crucial for organizing the electorate and helping people govern.Why were the Founding Fathers concerned about parties?The founders were concerned about the mischief of factions. They created this system of elaborate checks and balances to stop anybody from gaining too much power. What the founders created is something that Trump doesn’t like, where it is very hard for one faction to foist its will on others. The Founding Fathers tried to avoid factional disputes, and they did not succeed, because by 1800, the Jefferson versus Adams race was one of the meanest, nastiest party fights in history.No other democracy in the world nominates its candidates in primaries. All the parliamentary democracies have party conferences and they have lists. You can’t just go run for Parliament in Devonshire [in the United Kingdom]. You have to be placed on a list by the central party committee."
Pro-immigration activists rally at the Supreme Court,45,"The U.S. Supreme Court takes up a case on Monday probing the limits of presidential powers as the justices weigh whether President Obama overstepped his authority with unilateral action to protect millions of people in the country illegally from deportation.The case, pitting Obama against 26 states led by Texas that filed suit to block his 2014 immigration plan, is one of the biggest of the court’s current term ending in June.The court is evenly divided with four liberal justices and four conservatives following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 split that would leave in place a 2015 lower-court ruling that threw out the president’s executive action that bypassed the Republican-led Congress.Obama took the action after House of Representatives Republicans killed bipartisan legislation — billed as the biggest overhaul of U.S. immigration laws in decades and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants — that was passed by the Senate in 2013.Obama’s plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people — those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents — get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits.Obama’s program is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).Shortly before the plan was to take effect last year, a federal judge in Texas blocked it after the Republican-governed states filed suit against the Democratic president’s executive action. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in November.The Supreme Court’s ruling is due by the end of June.

Top Trump aide lobbied for Pakistani spy front,5797,"For more than five years, Donald Trump’s new top campaign aide, Paul Manafort, lobbied for a Washington-based group that Justice Department prosecutors have charged operated as a front for Pakistan’s intelligence service, according to court and lobbying records reviewed by Yahoo News.Manafort’s work in the 1990s as a registered lobbyist for the Kashmiri American Council was only one part of a wide-ranging portfolio that, over several decades, included a gallery of controversial foreign clients ranging from Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and Zaire’s brutal dictator Mobutu Sese Seko to an  Angolan rebel leader accused by human rights groups of torture. His role as an adviser to Ukraine’s then prime minister, Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, prompted concerns within the Bush White House that he was undermining U.S. foreign policy. It was considered so politically toxic in 2008 that presidential candidate John McCain nixed plans for Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention — a move that caused a rupture between Manafort and his then business partner, Rick Davis, who at the time was McCain’s campaign manager.Manafort’s work for the Kashmiri group has so far not gotten any media attention.But it could fuel more questions about his years of lobbying for questionable foreign interests before Manafort, 67, assumed his new position as chief delegate counter and strategist for a presidential candidate who repeatedly  decries the influence of Washington lobbyists  and denounces the manipulation of U.S. policy by foreign governments.Court records show that Manafort’s Kashmiri lobbying contract came on the FBI’s radar screen during a lengthy counterterrorism investigation that culminated in 2011 with the arrest of the Kashmiri council’s director, Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, on charges that he ran the group on behalf of Pakistan’s intelligence service, the ISI, as part of a scheme to secretly influence U.S. policy toward the disputed territory of Kashmir.Paul Manafort, convention manager for the Trump campaign, on “Meet the Press,” April 10. (Photo: William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images)The Kashmiri American Council was a “scam” that amounted to a “false flag operation that Mr. Fai was operating on behalf of the ISI,” Gordon D. Kromberg, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case, said in March 2012 at Fai’s sentencing hearing in federal court. While posing as a U.S.-based nonprofit funded by American donors sympathetic to the plight of Kashmiris, it was actually bankrolled by the ISI in order to deflect public attention “away from the involvement of Pakistan in sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir and elsewhere,” Kromberg said. Fai, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax fraud charges, was then sentenced to two years in federal prison.Lobbying records filed with the secretary of the Senate show that Manafort’s lobbying firm, Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly, was paid $700,000 by the Kashmiri American Council between 1990 and 1995. This was among more than $4 million that federal prosecutors alleged came from the ISI; Fai collected the money over 20 years from “straw” American donors who were being reimbursed from secret accounts in Pakistan. (The funds were in some cases delivered to Fai in brown paper bags stuffed with cash — and then the donors reimbursed with wire transfers from ISI operatives, according to an FBI affidavit.)Manafort, who handled the Kashmiri account for his firm, was never charged in the case, and Kromberg told Yahoo News that what knowledge, if any, he had of the secret source of money from his client was not part of the Justice Department’s investigation. (While registering with Congress as a domestic lobbyist for the Kashmiri American Council, Manafort never registered with the U.S. Justice Department as a foreign agent of Pakistan, as he would have been required to do if he was aware of the ISI funding of his client.)But a former senior Pakistani official, who asked not to be identified, told Yahoo News that there was never any doubt on Pakistan’s part that Manafort knew of his government’s role in backing the Kashmiri council. The former official said that during a trip from Islamabad in 1994 he met with Manafort and Fai in Manafort’s office in Alexandria, Va., “to review strategy and plans” for the council. Manafort, at the meeting, presented plans to influence members of Congress to back Pakistan’s case for a plebiscite for Kashmir (the largest portion of which has been part of India since 1947), he said. (Internal budget documents later obtained by the FBI show plans by the council to spend $80,000 to $100,000 a year on campaign contributions to members of Congress.) “There is no way Manafort didn’t know that Pakistan was involved with” the council, the former official said, although he added: “Some things are not explicitly stated.”Neither Manafort nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment for this story. (“I’m not working for any client right now other than working for Mr. Trump,” Manafort recently  said on NBC’s “Meet the Press”  when asked by moderator Chuck Todd about his past “controversial” clients.)

(Photo: Roshan Mughal/AP)But Manafort’s former partner Charlie Black, now an adviser to rival Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, said that as far as the firm was concerned, the Kashmiri council was a domestic, not a foreign, client. “Nobody was more surprised than me that the guy was taking the money from Pakistan,” Black said in a telephone interview. “We didn’t know anything about it.”But there was no doubt on the part of the Indian government about where the money was coming from. Its officials repeatedly alleged that the Kashmiri council was a front group for Pakistan during the period that Manafort’s firm was lobbying for it. The issue blew up in September 1993 after Manafort and one of his lobbying associates, Riva Levinson, traveled to Kashmir and, according to Indian officials, posed as CNN reporters in an effort to gather video footage of interviews with Kashmiri officials.“The whole thing was obviously a blatant operation of producing television software with a deliberate and particularly anti-Indian slant by lobbyists hired by Pakistan for this very purpose,” Shiv Shankar, then the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a letter to CNN in Atlanta at the time. (Levinson did not respond to a request for comment from Yahoo News. At the time she denied the Indian allegations, telling a UPI reporter, “We never misrepresented ourselves as journalists.”)Exactly what Manafort did for the Kashmiri council is unclear from the sketchy lobbying reports his firm filed with the secretary of the Senate. Those reports show his firm first registered as lobbyists for the group in October 1990, the same year the group was founded by Fai. The reports list little beyond the purpose of the lobbying: to seek support for a House resolution by then-Rep. Dan Burton to sponsor a “peaceful resolution” of the Kashmir dispute. They also show payments to the firm of $140,000 a year. (During this time, Black, Manafort had a long list of other domestic clients that included the NRA, the Tobacco Institute and the Trump Organization, which paid the firm $70,000 a year to lobby Congress on casino gambling, aviation and tax issues, according to the lobbying records.)“We went to the Hill for them to raise the profile of the [Kashmiri] cause,” said Black about the firm’s work for Fai’s council. “But nobody in Bush 41 [the administration of George H.W. Bush] or the Clinton administration wanted to touch it. We never got any real attention for it.”The FBI came across evidence that ISI was actually not pleased with Manafort’s work. The bureau’s investigation began in 2005 with a tip from a confidential informant (who was seeking a reduced prison term) that Fai and an associate in Pakistan, Zaheer Ahmad, were agents of the ISI. As part of the probe, agents obtained secret national security warrants to wiretap Fai’s communications; they also searched his home and offices. Among the evidence they seized: a December 1995 letter from Fai’s main ISI handler, identified as a Pakistani Army brigadier general named Javeed Aziz Khan, who went by the name of “Abdullah,” that criticized Fai for renewing a contract with a public relations firm, according to the FBI affidavit from a counterterrorism agent, Sarah Webb Linden, that was filed to support Fai’s detention in July 2011.Lobbyist Charlie Black (Photo: Tom Williams/Roll Call/Getty Images)Eight months later, at Fai’s sentencing hearing, prosecutor Kromberg for the first time identified the public relations firm as Black, Manafort, according to court records. He then detailed a dispute between Fai and his ISI handler over the Black, Manafort contract. Fai wrote back to Khan the next day insisting that the ISI official had in fact approved the renewal of the contract and noted that to “make it appear” that the council was a Kashmiri organization “financed by Americans,” there was a preexisting agreement that nobody from the Pakistani Embassy would ever contact Black, Manafort, said Kromberg. But Fai was overruled, according to Kromberg’s account. The ISI handler wrote back to Fai stating that that “‘we’ — a reference to the ISI — were unsatisfied with the performance of Black, Manafort & Stone, and advised Fai to terminate the contract immediately,” according to a transcript of Kromberg’s statement to the court.Meanwhile, the FBI pursued even more alarming allegations relating to Ahmad, Fai’s Pakistan-based associate. According to a ProPublica account, the bureau questioned witnesses about a trip that Ahmad had allegedly made to Afghanistan with a Pakistani nuclear scientist, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood; the scientist was suspecting of having met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in August 2001 to discuss the terror leaders’ interest in acquiring nuclear weapons.Manafort, for his part, appears to have expanded his business connections in Pakistan. In 2013 he acknowledged to French investigators that, in 1994, he had received $86,000 from two arms dealers involved in the sale of French attack submarines to Pakistan’s navy. The payments were part of an arrangement to compensate Manafort for political advice and polling he provided to French presidential candidate Édouard Balladur — one part of a wide-ranging French investigation into alleged kickbacks from arms sales dubbed by the French press “the Karachi affair.”One puzzling question about the Kashmir case is why, six years after the investigation began, the FBI decided to arrest Fai in 2011. One explanation, a source familiar with the case said, is that it came during a period of mounting tensions between the United States and Pakistan, much of it due to concerns among U.S. national security officials about the “double game” being played by the ISI. In May of that year, President Obama ordered the U.S. raid that killed bin Laden without informing the Pakistani military, in part because of fears that elements of the ISI (an arm of the military) might have been protecting the al-Qaida leader. Just weeks later, federal prosecutors in Chicago presented  damning testimony in federal court  that an ISI handler had directed one of the confessed conspirators in the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai — which killed 164 people, including six Americans — that was perpetrated by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani-based group with links to al-Qaida committed to “liberating” Muslims from Indian rule in Kashmir.Then, on July 18, after Fai returned from a trip to the United Kingdom, the FBI confronted him for the third time about whether he had any connections to the ISI — and he denied it. Fai was arrested, and he and Ahmad (who remained in Pakistan and died later that year) were charged in federal court with being unregistered foreign agents of Pakistan."
Johnny Depp's wife cops good behavior bond as Australia ends 'war on terrier',1750,"By Byron KayeSYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court let off the actress wife of Hollywood star Johnny Depp with a good behavior bond on Monday after she pleaded guilty to falsifying travel documents to sneak two pet dogs into the country.Depp accompanied his wife, Amber Heard, for the hearing at a packed courthouse in the Southport magistrates court, near where he had been shooting a “Pirates of the Caribbean” sequel when the scandal erupted last year.Bringing an end to what the Australian media had gleefully dubbed the “war on terrier”, a magistrate filed no conviction for Heard but issued a formal order to stay out of trouble for a month or face a A$1,000 ($767) fine.Heard, 29, had faced charges of illegally importing animals after authorities accused the couple of flying their Yorkshire Terriers, Pistol and Boo, into the country without going through proper quarantine procedures.But on Monday, the court learned that state prosecutors agreed to drop those charges when Heard pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of lying on an incoming passenger form when entering the country to visit Depp on set last year.For the A-list couple, the result is a reassuringly un-Hollywood ending to their brush with Australia’s notoriously tough quarantine laws.The original charges against Heard carried a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of A$10,000.The ruling also drew a line under the unlikely diplomatic tangle between the celebrity pair and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who in his capacity as farm minister threatened to have the dogs put down if Depp and Heard did not remove them.Depp made no comments before entering the courthouse other than brief pleasantries to waiting media.In court, Heard’s lawyers played a video apology in which the expressionless couple praised Australia’s biosecurity rules and Depp noted that “if you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly”.Heard added, in the video, that Australia was “a wonderful island” and she was “truly sorry that Pistol and Boo were not declared” because “protecting Australia is important”.Heard’s lawyer, Jeremy Kirk, told the court his client was jetlagged and worried about a hand injury Depp received on set, and believed all appropriate arrangements in relation to the dogs had been made.“She has made a tired, terrible mistake,” he said.For Joyce, the result also represents a win since it vindicates the rural politician’s decision to go public with his complaint about the couple’s violation of the country’s animal import laws. He faces a general election on July, with opinion polls showing support for the government sinking.In a statement, Joyce said he appreciated Heard’s “willingness to take responsibility for her actions” and “acknowledgement that she broke our national biosecurity laws”.He used more rugged language 11 months ago when he warned that “if we start letting movie stars, even though they’ve been the sexiest man alive twice — to come into our nation (with pets), then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody?”($1 = 1.3046 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Byron Kaye)"
Michelle Fields suggests ‘sketchy’ motives in prosecutor’s call to drop battery charges against Trump campaign manager,236,"Former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields appeared on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” Sunday for her first interview since her battery charges against Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski were dropped last week.Fields has been at the center of a media storm since she accused Lewandowski of forcefully grabbing her arm and nearly throwing her to the ground at a campaign event for the Republican presidential candidate in Jupiter, Fla., last month. But, she told CNN’s Brian Stelter, the controversy is less about the alleged manhandling itself than the Trump campaign’s dismissive response to her claim.“The reason why it’s such a huge story is because Corey lied, Donald Trump lied, they defamed me,” said Fields, who resigned from Breitbart News after she said management at the conservative website failed to adequately support her in the wake of the alleged altercation. “They went on this huge smear campaign against me, and I think it sheds light on the character of the campaign.”Trump publicly defended Lewandowski after Jupiter police charged him with simple battery last month, arguing that Fields was actually “grabbing at me” and that his campaign manager was “acting as an intermediary.”On Twitter, Trump further attempted to put the blame on Fields, accusing the reporter of changing her story and claiming that she was inappropriately grabbing him and shouting questions after his Florida press conference had finished.“Can I press charges?” Trump tweeted mockingly. Asked about Palm Beach County District Attorney Dave Aronberg’s decision last week to not pursue the assault charges against Lewandowski, Fields suggested the prosecutor may have been motivated by personal ties to Trump. “You look at the prosecutor’s wife’s social media, they are at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s resort, all of the time,” Fields said, noting that the website for Lynn Aronberg’s public relations firm prominently features photos of the prosecutor’s wife with Donald and Melania Trump. “I can’t speak for anyone else, but if I was a prosecutor and my wife was trying to monetize her relationship with Donald Trump and it’s right there on her website, and I’m partying all the time at Mar-a-Lago, I would recuse myself from the situation and the case.”Meanwhile, Lewandowski praised Aronberg’s decision and declined to apologize to Fields during his own TV appearance Sunday.“I’d be happy to have a conversation with her. But to apologize to someone I’ve never spoken to and, candidly, don’t ever remember having any interaction with is something that is a little unrealistic right now,” Lewandowski told Fox News’ Chris Wallace. “I’d be happy to have that conversation if we could put this thing behind us.”"
"Bill Clinton gets himself in trouble, but he’s an asset for Hillary in New York",1329,"NEW YORK, NY — “Yes!” a young man cried out, clutching his smartphone with one hand and using the other to push himself out of a throng of people. “I touched him!”None of the other people gathered in the small courtyard at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on Friday seemed to notice the man’s moment of personal triumph. They continued to clutch their phones and shuffle closer to the 42nd president of the United States, his white hair gleaming in the spring sunshine.Bill Clinton has crisscrossed New York City, stumping for his wife in the final weeks before Tuesday’s primary, meeting with Albanian-Americans in the Bronx, black churchgoers in Harlem, union workers in Midtown, and others. The former president has made a couple of high-profile mistakes here — including scolding activists for questioning his crime bill and mocking Bernie Sanders’ supporters. But Clinton’s team insists that his star power and gifted politicking will matter far more in the Empire State on Tuesday than his tendency to put his foot in his mouth.“I think there’s what you see covered in the press and then there’s the impact he has on voters,” said Clinton strategist Jen Palmieri. “He’s effective everywhere but he’s particularly effective in New York. You’ll see how the election turns out, but there’s a reason we use him a lot here.”Since leaving the White House, Clinton has rebranded himself as a New Yorker — basing his foundation’s offices in Harlem and befriending local politicians. Voters here feel like they know him.Former President Bill Clinton campaigns in support of his wife at the headquarters of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. (Photo: Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx/AP)“I love Bill Clinton!” said Marta Reyes, an administrator at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, who came outside to hear him speak on Friday. “I felt so hurt that he couldn’t run another time. And a lot of people felt that way.”“I came to shake his hand,” said Margaret Gaines, a pharmacy technician at the event. “I want a selfie!”Bill Clinton doesn’t just offer familiarity; he offers entertainment. The former president’s stump speech, in a refreshing contrast to his wife’s, can be unpredictable. “People are interested in what he says,” said Richard Socarides, a former aide in the Clinton White House who is running to be a Clinton pledged delegate in New York. “He’s still incredibly dynamic and … he’s often quite provocative.”While Clinton generates excitement and press coverage, he also causes headaches for the much more on-message, conservative Hillary Clinton campaign. The former president has moments when he presents an argument for Hillary in a clear and folksy way that resonates with the room, when his pride in her achievements appears to charm the crowd. But other times, he gets sidetracked defending his own record or legacy, taking him off his wife’s message and occasionally even criticizing Obama. “I think it’s always going to be challenging to find the right balance between his role as a spouse and a role as former president,” Socarides said.At an event in Philadelphia earlier this month, he shouted at two black protesters who came to speak out against his 1994 crime bill and Hillary Clinton’s advocacy for it. (Hillary Clinton referred to young people who commit violent crimes as “super predators” in 1996; she has since disavowed the term.) “You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,” Clinton said.He then launched into a lengthy defense of the bill, which Hillary has distanced herself from, making criminal justice reform a key part of her platform. “Because of that bill, we have a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in murder rate,” Bill Clinton said. It took him several minutes to get back to his wife. “Hillary didn’t vote for that bill, because she wasn’t in the Senate,” he finally said, adding that she was the “first candidate” who backed getting nonviolent offenders out of prison.The Sanders campaign jumped on the exchange. “Our senior statesman should not be mistreating our young activists,” said Sanders surrogate and former head of the NAACP Ben Jealous. “I worry that he thought he was blowing his old dog whistle that day, and he should keep that dog whistle in his pocket.” (Clinton raised the ire of some African-American voters during the 2008 campaign when he referred to Obama’s candidacy as a “fairytale” and compared his presidential run to Jesse Jackson’s. When the Obama campaign objected to these remarks as racially tinged, Clinton argued that they “played the race card” on him.)Then, on Friday, the former president joked at an event in Fort Washington that Sanders’ message to his young supporters is “just shoot every third person on Wall Street and everything will be fine.“ Sanders shot back on Twitter that the president was “disparaging” the young people who backed him.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>It’s not his speeches, however, but rather what comes after them that can cause the most stress for the Clinton campaign. The former president almost never misses the opportunity to greet voters who crowd around him on the rope line after events — and he’s been known to answer questions from reporters who infiltrate the line. According to one Clinton aide, the former president’s press secretary, Angel Urena, follows him closely while Bill works rope lines after his events.“Every rope line, he’s so stressed,” the aide said of Bill Clinton’s press secretary. “If he wants to answer a question, he’s going to answer the question.”Even with his missteps and unpredictability, the Clinton campaign is grateful to have a former and largely popular president at hand to fill up organizing rallies and motivate the base. Hillary said at a recent debate that she’s not a “natural” politician like her husband, and it does seem clear that Bill enjoys himself, especially while working the rope line after events. He has heartfelt conversations with voters as others crush in, videotaping him. By the end of his hand shaking and selfie taking and stranger hugging, he will sometimes sprint back for one more voter interaction, like a sugar addict diving back to the candy jar. At a packed event in a Long Island restaurant earlier this month, he appeared to be halfway out of the venue before he dashed back to quickly grab a pink-swaddled baby for one last photo op.He hoisted the baby above his head as voters squealed in delight."
George Clooney: Bernie Sanders is ‘absolutely right — it is an obscene amount of money’,8393,"George Clooney in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. (NBC)Actor George Clooney says Bernie Sanders is “absolutely right” to criticize the big-money fundraisers he co-hosted for Hillary Clinton over the weekend.“I think it’s an obscene amount of money,” Clooney said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an interview that aired Sunday. “The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right. It’s ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. I agree completely.”On Saturday, Clooney and his wife hosted a $33,400-per-person fundraiser for the Democratic frontrunner at the couple’s Los Angeles home. On Friday at a fundraiser in San Francisco — where Clinton had asked donors for $353,400 for two seats at the head table with herself, Clooney and his wife, Amal — a group of about 100 protesters demonstrated outside the event, which was held at the home of venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar.The 54-year-old Academy Award winner said he agreed with them too.“They’re right to protest,” Clooney said. “They’re absolutely right. It is an obscene amount of money.”Both events were benefits for the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising effort for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.Sanders had called Clinton’s use of people like Clooney “the problem with American politics.”“It is obscene that Secretary Clinton keeps going to big-money people to fund her campaign,” the Vermont senator said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” last month. “I have a lot of respect for George Clooney. He’s a great actor. I like him. But this is the problem with American politics … Big money is dominating our political system. And [my supporters and I] are trying to move as far away from that as we can.”Sanders, whose campaign has been largely funded by small donations, says his events usually cost “$15 or $50” to get into.“So it’s not a criticism of Clooney,” he said. “It’s a criticism of a corrupt campaign finance system, where big money interests — and it’s not Clooney, it’s the people coming to this event — have undue influence on the political process.”Sanders was asked about Clooney’s “Meet the Press” comments on Sunday’s “State of the Union.”“I have a lot of respect for George Clooney’s honesty and integrity on this issue,” the senator said. “He is right. One of the great tragedies of American life today is the degree to which big money is buying elections, in which elected officials become responsive to the needs of Wall Street and wealthy campaign contributors, rather than the needs of ordinary people.”Sanders was also asked if he feels Clooney is “backing the wrong horse.”“Well, I think he is,” Sanders said. “But he is honest enough to say that there is something wrong when few people, in this case wealthy individuals, but in other instances for the secretary, it is Wall Street and powerful special interests, who are able to contribute unbelievably large sums of money. That’s not what democracy is about.”"
"Trump on Zuckerberg’s comments: ‘He never mentioned me by name, so perhaps he’s talking about somebody else’",2196,"Trump at a campaign rally in Syracuse, N.Y., on Saturday. (Photo: Carlo Allegri/Reuters)Donald Trump did something unusual when he was asked about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s recent criticism of his controversial plan to build a wall along the U.S. southern border — he didn’t fire back.“Well, I never met him, I never spoke to him, and he never mentioned me by name,” Trump said in a phone interview with “Fox & Friends” on Saturday. “So perhaps he’s talking about somebody else.”Not likely. Zuckerberg kicked off the social network’s F8 developer conference in San Francisco on Thursday with an uncharacteristically political speech that seemed to take dead aim at the Republican frontrunner.“As I look around and I travel around the world, I’m starting to see people and nations turning inward, against this idea of a connected world and a global community,” Zuckerberg said. “I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as ‘others.’”The billionaire real estate mogul, though, was unmoved by the billionaire tech entrepreneur.“We do have to have a wall, we need security, we need borders,” Trump said. “And if we don’t have borders, we don’t have a country.”But the former “Celebrity Apprentice” host was not ready to slam one of his most effective campaign messaging platforms, either.“I think Facebook is good, and I can’t imagine them doing anything,” Trump said. “I’m one of their great stars.”Indeed, Trump’s presidential bid has been propelled, in part, by his outsize presence on social media. He has more than 7.6 million followers on Twitter and just over 7 million on Facebook. (There’s even a website that allows Facebook users to quickly check which of their friends “like” Trump.)On Friday, Gizmodo published an image of an internal poll that showed that Facebook employees had voted last month to ask Zuckerberg whether the company had a “responsibility” to “prevent President Trump in 2017.”Following Gizmodo’s report, the company worked quickly to avoid any appearance of electioneering.“We encourage any and all candidates, groups, and voters to use our platform to share their views on the election and debate the issues,” Facebook said in a statement. “We as a company are neutral — we have not and will not use our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote.”"
John Kasich suggests women can avoid rape by forgoing drunken parties,9795,"Another day on the campaign trail, another eyebrow-raising comment about what women should or shouldn’t do. This time the advice came from Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, the governor of Ohio.At a town hall in Watertown, N.Y., a first-year student from St. Lawrence University asked Kasich what he’d do as president to help her feel safer regarding “sexual violence, harassment and rape.”Kasich launched into a quick speech about ensuring rape kits and other resources are available to victims of sexual assault.“In our state, we think that when you enroll you ought to absolutely know that if something happens to you along the lines of sexual harassment or whatever, you have a place to go where there is a confidential reporting, where there is an ability for you to access a rape kit, where that is kept confidential, but where it gives you an opportunity to be able to pursue justice after you have had some time to reflect on it all,” he said. “We are in a process of making sure that all higher education in our state — and this ought to be done in the country — that our coeds know exactly what the rules are, what the opportunities are, what the confidential policies are, so that you are not vulnerable, at risk and can be preyed upon.”Continued the student, who had not finished saying her piece, “It’s sad that it’s something that I have to worry about just walking…”“I’d also give you one bit of advice,” Kasich interrupted. “Don’t go to parties where there’s a lot of alcohol.” The room burst into applause.With this comment, Kasich joined the ranks of those who place the onus for decreasing sexual assaults on female college students, asking them to alter their behaviors and avoid important campus social functions, while the lifestyles and habits of their male counterparts are treated as an unchangeable norm that does not need addressing. This line of thinking runs counter to recent national efforts to address sexual assault on campuses by encouraging bystander intervention and teaching men it is their responsibility not to hurt women, among other things.It was hardly Kasich’s first time getting tripped up in response to a question by a young woman. Here are some other instances in which he has spoken to or about women awkwardly — or even, some would say, offensively.Taylor Swift ticketsIn an earlier run-in with a female college student, Kasich last October offended 18-year-old college newspaper staffer Kayla Solsbak when she raised her hand to ask a question and he reportedly said, “I’m sorry, I don’t have any Taylor Swift concert tickets.” She went on to pen an op-ed that called his comments condescending.Women in kitchens “How did I get elected?” Kasich asked at a campaign event on February. “I didn’t have anybody for me. We just got an army of people, and many women who left their kitchens to go out and to go door to door to put up yard signs for me.” Kasich later conceded women don’t hang out so much in kitchens these days, and later apologized if he offended anyone.Social Security surpriseAt another town hall, Kasich reportedly expressed bewilderment after a young woman asked him a Social Security question, wondering whether someone had told her to inquire about the topic. “I think for myself,” she replied.The budget slim-down dietDuring a November town hall in Iowa, Kaisch chose to describe balancing a budget to a female reporter by asking her, “Have you ever been on a diet?”So there you have it. Young women questioners, you are John Kasich’s kryptonite."
FAQ: How Obama plans to fix cable TV and why it matters to you,893,"President Obama is signing an executive order that would push federal agencies to identify sectors of the economy where growth has stalled due to lack of competition. The first target of that order: your cable box.Before you freak out: No, Obama isn’t trying to take over your TV, monitor what you watch, or keep you from tuning in to The Real Housewives of New Jersey (though you really shouldn’t be watching that anyway).Instead, the order will attempt to open up cable and satellite providers’ set-top box systems so that third-party companies can create competing boxes and apps.Read more: Big cable to FCC: Kiss our apps Under Obama’s order, the Commerce Department is calling on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to do what it can to increase competition in the set-top box market.It matters because increased competition over which set-top box you use could help cut your cable or satellite bill by more than $200 a year.According to a report by Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, cable and satellite companies have been pulling in up to $20 billion a year from rental fees for consumers’ boxes.The majority of Americans who have cable or satellite rent their set-top boxes from their TV providers. With an average of two boxes per house, that adds up to more than $200 per year per customer in rental fees.Mainly because there aren’t that many alternatives on the market.Sure, you can use a CableCard that slides into a cable box you’ve purchased. But you still have to pay a fee for the card, and the setup isn’t exactly intuitive.TiVo, meanwhile, has a set-top box alternative, but that also comes with its own monthly fees.As a result, the vast majority of Americans still rent their cable boxes.Sort of. Back in January, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed new regulations that would open up the set-top box market to third parties. It’s essentially the same idea that the Commerce Department is pushing now.But there needs to be time for the public to comment on that FCC proposal; the commission would likely move to adopt some kind of final rule by the end of the year.If third-party companies are able to build and sell their own set-top boxes, that would eliminate the need to pay your TV provider that monthly rental fee. After a few months, your new third-party box would pay for itself.You may already do the same thing — you bought your own instead of renting — with the cable modem and router you use to get Internet service from your cable company. (If you aren’t doing so, I’d strongly recommend looking into it.)More competition could also lead to software developers building apps for your Roku and Apple TV or even your smartphone and tablet that would let you watch cable or satellite programming without even needing a box.Currently, if you want to use a cable or satellite provider’s apps, you usually need at least one set-top box in your home. That could change, though, if Wheeler and Obama have their way.They’re predictably unhappy with the proposed changes. Their argument is that if we move forward with Wheeler’s proposed changes, consumers will have to buy new devices, and innovation would hit a roadblock. You’ll notice that’s the exact opposite of what the plan intends.See, even if the rule changes go into effect, you don’t have to buy anything. If you’re happy paying a monthly rental fee for your cable box, you can go right ahead and do so. But if you want to eliminate that fee from your bill, you’ll be able to do that too.Similarly, it’s hard to fathom how allowing third-party manufacturers and app developers to create new ways for you to watch TV will negatively impact innovation.Basically, what this comes down to is that cable and satellite providers don’t want to lose out on that sweet $20 billion they’ve been getting. And that’s understandable: No industry would want to lose that kind of revenue. But I’ve got a feeling they’ll figure out some other way to make up for it.Email Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley."
Sanders camp suspends new Jewish outreach coordinator over controversial Facebook post,1220,"Bernie Sanders at the National Action Network Conference in New York City, April 14, 2016. (Photo: Dennis Van Tine/Star Max/IPx) Just two days into her new job as national Jewish outreach coordinator for the Bernie Sanders campaign, Simone Zimmerman has been suspended for writing profane Facebook posts about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Zimmerman, an outspoken critic of the Israeli government, was a somewhat controversial choice from the start. The New York Times reported late Thursday that “a chorus of Jewish figures” had called on the Sanders campaign to dismiss the 25-year-old, but that “the final straw was a report on Wednesday in the Washington Free Beacon,” highlighting a March 3, 2015, Facebook post in which Zimmerman called Netanyahu “an arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative a**hole.” “F*** you, Bibi,” read the original post, which Zimmerman later edited with less crude language. “You sanctioned the murder of over 2,000 people this summer.”“She has been suspended while we investigate the matter,” Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told the Times via email.The news comes just days before the primary election in New York — home to the country’s largest concentration of Jewish voters, a population Sanders has struggled to court.In fact, recent polls have found that more than 60 percent of Jewish Democrats in New York support Hillary Clinton over Sanders, a Brooklyn native who has already made it further in this presidential campaign than any other Jewish candidate in history.While his campaign’s decision to suspend Zimmerman may reflect an attempt to appeal to more mainline Jewish voters ahead of Tuesday’s primary, for some voters Zinmerman’s comments may underscore suspicions about how strong a supporter of Israel, sanders is—suspicions that may be reinforced by statements he made during Thursday night’s debate.“As somebody who is 100 percent pro-Israel … in the long run, if we are ever going to bring peace to that region, which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity,” Sanders said at the Democratic debate in his native Brooklyn Thursday. “I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people. That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think, to an approach that works in the Middle East.”"
"Unconventional #2: Cruz’s new delegate guru, how the iPhone will change a contested convention, another Trump setback in SC (and more!)",53,"Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli in 2014. (Photo: Steve Helber/AP)Unconventional is Yahoo News’ complete guide to the craziest presidential conventions in decades. Here’s what you need to know today.For the last month, former Virginia attorney general and 2013 gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli has been overseeing Ted Cruz’s crack delegate operation, which has been routing Donald Trump’s team at every turn. He’s also in charge of Cruz’s convention strategy. With a contested convention growing more likely every day, Cuccinelli is poised to be one of the biggest players in Cleveland. He spoke to Unconventional about why Cruz is dominating the delegate fight, how his team plans to win over most of Marco Rubio’s supporters — and what he expects to happen on the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena in July. Excerpts:UNCONVENTIONAL: How has your experience in Virginia politics prepared you for this role?CUCCINELLI: Virginia has elections every year — odd years and even years. And we frequently, if not usually, nominate by convention. Just like I can’t tell you how many trials and motions I’ve done as an attorney — I literally have no idea, I’ve done so many — I can’t tell you how many conventions I’ve been involved in one way or another. Winning, losing, four ways, three ways, one-on-one, scaring out an opponent — I mean, everything. I’ve had to recruit people district by district, get them to the convention, whip the votes, track the votes, set up that whole system. I had good teams in those races. I have a spectacular team in this presidential race. Donald Trump says the system is rigged and the GOP is conspiring to steal the nomination from him. I’d like to give you a chance to respond. Are you conspiring to steal the nomination from Donald Trump? No. He’s whining, we’re winning. His campaign is incapable of competing in this environment, so they’re lashing out. We’re just doing the fundamentals well.I mean, Trump has 37 percent of the vote and around 45 percent of the delegates. He has a disproportionate share of the delegates. Is that fair? Well, yes. Why is it fair? Because those were the rules at the beginning. Logically, you can’t have it both ways. You can’t like the rules when they favor you and dislike them when they don’t. But Donald, apparently, thinks he can.Why is the Cruz campaign beating the Trump campaign at the delegate game in state after state? The Cruz campaign has been built on grassroots support from the beginning. If you compare that kind of foundation to a media-based campaign, each one has its advantages and disadvantages. I don’t know of any presidential candidate who has so completely dominated media for as long as Donald Trump. But that gets you on television. It makes impressions. It doesn’t build infrastructure.A grassroots campaign is not as sexy, perhaps. It’s a lot harder-working. A lot more slogging in the trenches. But you build something: You build networks of people who work together to achieve a goal. And ultimately, this kind of campaign is ideally suited to a delegate campaign that changes from state to state, and from county to county or even district to district. It is a minefield of minutia. And you don’t just have to stay on top of it as a campaign. You have to have recruited committed supporters who themselves will stay on top of it. We have. Trump is way ahead in New York and in the Northeastern states that vote the following week. Where’s the next big delegate opportunity for Cruz? Wyoming. And every weekend, and sometimes on weeknights, there are district and state conventions where the delegates who are going to Cleveland are decided. We’ve emptied the offices going to conventions this weekend. What about Pennsylvania? Most of the Pennsylvania delegates are unbound. You could lose the popular vote there and still control the delegation. And West Virginia.Are those big targets for Cruz?Nothing where the delegate is actually selected is not a big target for us.Some have said that California and Indiana could be strong points for Cruz.Utah was a strong point. I think Indiana and California will be competitive. They haven’t seen a meaningful Republican presidential primary in a long time.What about Marco Rubio’s delegates? Do you expect to turn most of them into Cruz delegates? I do. When I was making phone calls in Iowa for Ted, and then in Nevada, and my phone calls in Virginia, it took me a long time to notice a pattern that I hadn’t taken note of before. I asked one of the Cruz office managers in Nevada. I said, “Hey, Matt, I’ve run into hundreds of people choosing between Rubio and Cruz, and I’ve run into hundreds of people choosing between Trump and Cruz, but I’ve yet to encounter a person deciding between Rubio and Trump. Have you found any of those?” And it was like a light bulb went off. I could see him react, and go, “Now that you mention it, I can’t remember a single one.”Paul Manafort, Trump’s convention manager, recently said that “there’s not going to be a second ballot” in Cleveland. What do you think?He can say what he wants to say. We’re going to compete all the way across the 1,237 threshold. And until somebody gets there, there will be more ballots.So far all I’ve heard [Manafort] do is lob really horrific accusations. Like his comment that we’re using “Gestapo-like tactics” to win over delegates. I hope it hurts them. I find it irresponsible. It does tell me that they are very, very afraid.Of what? Losing on a second ballot in Cleveland?You can ask him. I have a great deal of confidence that the delegate operation we’re building is going to be very, very robust. It’s going to be the most capable one in the convention, bar none. And I think that will get us over the top.When a football team gets into the red zone, you don’t give them a touchdown. We’re playing against a football team that wants to cross the 20 and scream like a child that they be given a touchdown. Lots of football teams get all the way to the red zone and lose. And that’s my plan for their football team._____With no clear path left to winning a majority of pledged delegates during primaries and caucuses, Bernie Sanders is now pinning his hopes on a different species of delegate. “[Superdelegates] don’t count until they vote, and they don’t vote until we get to the convention,” Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver recently argued. “So when we arrive at the convention, it will be an open convention, likely with neither candidate having a majority of pledged delegates. So I think it’ll be an interesting Democratic convention.” But who are these superdelegates? And what makes them so special? Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric breaks it down._____Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: APBy Alyssa BereznakThe last time Americans witnessed a contested convention with multiple rounds of balloting was in 1952. That was back when the closest thing we had to a computer was a giant calculator, telephones required land lines, and the founder of Twitter had yet to be conceived.Technologically, the 2016 landscape is much different. According to a recent report from Politico, each candidate’s team has already begun developing tech tools to better navigate the chaotic task of memorizing the faces, names and home states of each of the 2,472 delegates in attendance. All of this political negotiating will take place as smartphone-toting supporters of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich document the scene via Snapchat and Vines, producing their own real-time feed full of rumors of what’s happening.(For the full story, click here.)A Trump convention strategist told Politico that his team will use some sort of “custom-built hardware” with a “closed loop” system that would allow his staff to communicate efficiently without having to rely on potentially unreliable Wi-Fi (which sounds suspiciously like a walkie-talkie). Cruz’s team plans to build an iPhone app that works offline and contains strategic data about each delegate and whether they might be swayed. Kasich has yet to divulge a strategy. Ideally each candidate’s team will need a tool that can 1) effectively record and deliver data without relying on what will likely be an exhausted Wi-Fi network, and 2) possibly identify or track delegates on the floor.When it comes to battling the congested cellular network that candidates are sure to encounter during the convention, one of the most reliable options for teams to communicate may be a mesh network. These wireless networks can function entirely without Internet connection, as long as a minimum number of people in a concentrated location are logged on.Depending on the guidelines that the Republican National Convention rules committee sets before the event, candidates may also attempt to use tracking techniques that have traditionally been used at trade shows. Organizers can track attendees by placing radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips inside their badges, each of which contain information about an individual. According to Brian Ludwig, a senior vice president of sales at the event technology company Cvent, it’s common practice to code certain categories into each attendee’s chip, such as their state or industry. This same technology could be incredibly helpful to tipping off candidates’ teams about where delegates are traveling on the convention floor.If convention organizers are unwilling to offer that kind of information to campaign staff, another option could be beacon technology. Here’s how it works: Candidates could ask delegates to download and activate an app made specifically for the convention. At the same time, staff could strategically place small trackers — $20 contraptions shaped like hockey pucks — around key locations in the arena. If a delegate’s phone’s Bluetooth is on and he or she passes a beacon sensor, the app can automatically send a push notification to that delegate’s phone.According to Ludwig, Cvent is in talks with the RNC to provide preregistration, online check-in, badges and a mobile app for an event made up of about 1,300 “major VIP-donor types” at the National Convention. Whether Trump, Cruz or Kasich will eventually adopt any of the company’s techniques, however, remains to be seen.Want to know more?

Sanders at Vatican says rich-poor gap worse than 100 years ago,97,"By Philip PullellaVATICAN CITY (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, addressing a Vatican conference on social justice on Friday, decried the “immoral” gap between the world’s rich and poor that he said was worse than a century ago.The Democratic hopeful from Vermont has campaigned on a vow to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower-income Americans who he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of Pope Francis.The trip is inconveniently timed for 74-year-old senator, coming four days before a Democratic party primary in New York. A loss there would blunt his momentum after winning seven of the last eight state contests and give front-runner Hillary Clinton a boost in her drive to the party’s presidential nomination.Sanders said in his speech to the Pontifical Academy of Social Science that the Roman Catholic Church’s first encyclical on social justice, written in 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, lamented the enormous gap between the rich and the poor.“That situation is worse today. In the year 2016, the top 1 percent of the people on this planet own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent,” the self-described democratic socialist said.“At a time when so few have so much, and so many have so little, we must reject the foundations of this contemporary economy as immoral and unsustainable,” he said.Sanders, the Brooklyn-born son of Polish Jewish immigrants, has said the trip was not a pitch for the Catholic vote but a testament to his admiration for Pope Francis, whom he is not expected to see during his flying visit.He will be back on the campaign trail on Sunday.CHANTS OF “BERNIE, BERNIE” AT VATICAN GATE After reading the speech in the academy building inside the Vatican grounds, Sanders walked outside one of the city-state’s gates to talk to reporters and was greeted by chants of “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie” from a vocal group of local supporters.Pope Francis sent a message to the academy, saying he had wanted to meet the conference participants in the evening, but could not because he is leaving Rome early on Saturday to visit refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos.Saying he was “proud and excited to be here”, Sanders praised the pope’s visionary views about creating “a moral economy, an economy that works for all people and not just for the people on top”.Reflecting the themes of his campaign, he said he and the pope both agreed that “we’ve got to ingrain moral principles into our economy and there is no area where that is clearer than the area of climate change. The greed of the fossil fuel industry is literally destroying our planet”.Pope Francis wrote a major encyclical, or papal treatise, last year on the need to respect the environment.In other parts of his speech, Sanders decried “reckless financial deregulation,” including rules on political party financing, that he said had “established a system in which billionaires can buy elections” in exchange for laws that would make them only richer.“Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, we have been left with an economy operated for the top one percent, who get richer and richer as the working class, the young and the poor fall further and further behind,” he said.Sanders will spend less than 24 hours in Rome before returning to the campaign trail before the New York primary on Tuesday.(Additional reporting by Crispian Balmer in Rome and John Whitesides in Washington; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"
A contested convention in the age of the smartphone,269,"This July, thousands of delegates, party officials, campaign staff and journalists will descend on the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention. It is possible, or even likely, that no candidate will win the presidential nomination on the first or second ballots — something that hasn’t happened since 1952, back when the closest thing to a computer was a giant calculator, telephones required land lines, and the founder of Twitter had yet to be conceived. Though candidates were able to use broadcast television as a tool to influence results, any backdoor power brokering at the convention went relatively undocumented.Technologically, the 2016 landscape is much different. In the era of the iPhone, the near 20,000-person crowd that will fill the Quicken Loans Arena will serve as both its own private media network and — depending on the capabilities of the venue — a bandwidth-swamping black hole. 2,472 people in that crowd will be the delegates who will vote to nominate the president. And, according to a recent report from Politico, each candidate’s team has already begun developing tech tools for tracking the faces, names, and home states of each of them. All of this political negotiating will take place as smartphone-toting supporters of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich document the scene via Snapchat and Vine, producing their own real-time feeds full of rumors and disinformation.But the precise technology that will be at play on the convention floor is still anyone’s guess. A Trump convention strategist told Politico that his team will use some sort of “custom-built hardware” with a “closed loop” system that would allow his staff to communicate efficiently without having to rely on potentially unreliable Wi-Fi (it sounds suspiciously like a walkie-talkie). Cruz’s team, on the other hand, plans to build an iPhone app that works offline and contains strategic data about each delegate and whether they might be swayed. Kasich has yet to divulge a strategy. Ideally, each candidate’s team will need a tool that can (1) effectively record and deliver data and messages without relying on what will likely be an overwhelmed Wi-Fi network, and (2) possibly identify or track delegates on the floor.Though some “House of Cards” buffs might think a campaign tracks delegates via a big whiteboard in a hotel room, state-specific rules make record keeping much more complicated. Depending on whether you’re a delegate from Iowa or a delegate from Hawaii, you may be bound to vote for a given candidate for one or more rounds of voting. Any data-based tracking app would need to account for this web of restrictions and send push alerts when a delegate is free to change his vote, so the managers know the best time to court him.When it comes to battling the congested cellular network that candidates are sure to encounter during the convention, one of the most reliable options for teams to communicate may be a mesh network app like FireChat. These wireless networks can function entirely without Internet, as long as a minimum number of people in a concentrated location use them. FireChat uses Bluetooth and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections to link up nearby phones that also have the app installed. If enough people have the app, they form a distributed network and can pass messages along in one large public stream.According to Christophe Daligault, a marketing officer at FireChat, tools like these have become popular during political events when Wi-Fi networks are overwhelmed — or when authorities shut down Internet services in order to control information. The app first took off during the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in August 2014, when half a million people used it during the span of a week. Since then, it’s been used during elections in the Congo and Venezuela, and for less formal instances on cruise ships or at Burning Man. Daligault said his team briefly met with then-Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul last year to discuss his campaign’s possible use of the app.FireChat currently works as a type of location-based Twitter feed, where everyone in one particular location can see the messages that people are typing into the app. But within the next month, it will allow users to create their own private networks so they can invite only their acquaintances.“The beauty of it is, it goes wherever you go,” Daligault told Yahoo News. “It’s your own social network that doesn’t need a network.”Depending on the guidelines that the Republican National Convention rules committee sets before the event, candidates may also attempt to use tracking techniques that have traditionally been used at trade shows. Organizers can track attendees by placing radio frequency identification (RFID) chips inside their badges, each of which contains information about an individual. According to Brian Ludwig, a senior vice president of sales at the event technology company Cvent, it’s common practice to code certain categories into each attendee’s chip, such as his state or industry. This same technology could be incredibly helpful to tipping off candidates’ teams about where delegates are traveling on the convention floor.“I want to know who’s going in on the trade show floor, how long they’re standing in front of certain booths, and the interested parties,” he told Yahoo News. “You could have someone scanning folks at the door. But that’s obtrusive, and you have to have staff. Putting mats down or RFID panels on doorways can allow less obvious tracking of folks.”If convention organizers are unwilling to offer that kind of information to campaign staff, another option could be to use something called beacon technology. Here’s how it works: Candidates could ask delegates to download and activate an app made specifically for the convention. Strategically placed small trackers — $20 contraptions shaped like hockey pucks — at key locations in the arena would register a delegate’s presence, as long as his or her Bluetooth is on, and automatically send a push notification to that delegate’s phone.“At the end of the day, when someone goes to that convention their inbox is a mess,” Ludwig said. “They’re going to have 500 emails by the time they leave after a couple days. Literally the best conduit to someone’s eyeballs is not by sending them an email or text, but sending them a push notification that pops no matter what, even if the app is closed down.”According to Ludwig, Cvent is in talks with the RNC to provide preregistration, online check-in, badges, and a mobile app for an event made up of about 1,300 “major VIP donor types” at the convention. Whether Trump, Cruz, or Kasich will eventually adopt any of the company’s techniques, however, is yet to be seen."
Trump takes ‘rigged system’ rant to the Wall Street Journal,178,"Donald Trump took his tirade against the Republican Party’s delegate selection process to the Wall Street Journal’s opinion page Friday.In an op-ed titled “Let Me Ask America a Question,” Trump continued to rail, as he has for the past week, against the “rigged” system that he argues unfairly allowed rival Ted Cruz to nab all of Colorado’s 34 Republican delegates last weekend.“I, for one, am not interested in defending a system that for decades has served the interest of political parties at the expense of the people,” Trump wrote, slamming the decision made by the state’s Republican leaders last August to forgo the party’s typical primary vote in favor of more of a convention-style delegate selection. “Members of the club — the consultants, the pollsters, the politicians, the pundits and the special interests — grow rich and powerful while the American people grow poorer and more isolated.”  Despite Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus’ insistence that Colorado’s chosen system was “perfectly OK,” Trump dismissed Cruz’s “voterless victory in Colorado” as proof that the Texas senator is simply an establishment stooge to Trump’s man of the people. “For a man who styles himself as a warrior against the establishment (you wouldn’t know it from his list of donors and endorsers), you’d think he would be demanding a vote for Coloradans,” he wrote. “Instead, Mr. Cruz is celebrating their disenfranchisement.”The op-ed elaborates on complaints the Republican presidential frontrunner made earlier in the week via Twitter and Fox News about Colorado’s closed convention, which he claims was a deliberate attempt by party insiders to stifle his supporters. “Let us make Colorado a rallying cry on behalf of all the forgotten people whose desperate pleas have for decades fallen on the deaf ears and closed eyes of our rulers in Washington, D.C.,” he wrote. “The political insiders have had their way for a long time. Let 2016 be remembered as the year the American people finally got theirs.”Encouraged by Trump, disgruntled supporters plan to protest the results of last weekend’s convention at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday. "
‘You’ll always be First Lady to us’ — letters among presidential wives,1230,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos (clockwise from top left): ABC via Getty Images, Hulton Archive/Getty Images, Harry Langdon/Getty Images, John Duricka/AP, Hulton Archive/Getty Images, Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThey are mostly on monogrammed stationery and handwritten, though a few are typed, and there are some store-bought cards here and there. They are filled with a smattering of reflections on national policy but mostly the safer topics of husbands and children, diets and dinners, joy and loss. They are exchanged between correspondents who may agree on everything and also those who disagree on so many things. They often have “Do Not Respond,” or some similar phrase, scribbled in the corner, because they all know how obligations can pile up in this most exclusive of jobs.They are notes between modern first ladies, ranging from Jackie Kennedy to Michelle Obama — a handful of women who are the only ones who know what it really means to play that role. “Presidents are members of the world’s most selective fraternity, and the first ladies are members of the world’s most elite sorority,” says Kate Andersen Brower, author of the new book “First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies.”A former reporter for Bloomberg News, Andersen Brower was drawn to the subject after covering Michelle Obama and seeing how the first lady was at once so visible and so guarded. What she found was a club, of sorts, of women who studied and consulted each other before they took the job and kept in touch afterward.Much of her material comes from correspondence between the first ladies themselves, which she found in “boring-looking” folders in presidential libraries of their husbands, where she was sometimes the first visitor to request the material.There was a lot of superficial banter, along with social niceties, in those folders.Barbara Bush to Lady Bird Johnson after Johnson’s yearly gift of Texas pralines:“Only someone who lived in the White House would know that, although the food is the best in the world, the cupboard is bare in the upstairs kitchen.”Lady Bird Johnson to Laura Bush, who had inquired about Johnson’s health in her later years:“I don’t even buy green bananas anymore.”Barbara Bush to Betty Ford:Bush sent Ford a politically-themed Hallmark card for one birthday that read: “We started out to get a signature for each of your birthdays and before we knew it – It turned into a petition drive. You are now eligible to run for office in 23 states!!” It was signed, “You’ll always be First Lady to us! Happy Birthday, with Respect and Love, Barbara B.”And then there were the letters to Pat Nixon, written on her 81st birthday after the former chief usher of the White House quietly alerted all the first ladies that Nixon was in very poor health. (She would die months later.) There were surprising kindnesses and even friendships across parties and ideologies.Jackie Kennedy to Pat Nixon:After the man defeated by her husband in 1960 was elected president in 1968, Mrs. Kennedy sent a handwritten note 23 blocks south from her apartment at 1040 Fifth Ave. to the Nixons’ apartment at 810 Fifth Ave. Kennedy congratulated Nixon, adding, “You are such a close family that I know you will be able to be happy in spite of the pressure and the absence of privacy.”Pat Nixon to Jackie Kennedy:After turning down several invitations for Lady Bird Johnson to return with her children to the White House for a visit, Pat Nixon wrote to extend the same invitation in 1971, promising that the event (on the occasion of the unveiling of John F. Kennedy’s White House portrait) would be kept entirely “private.”To Nixon’s surprise, Kennedy accepted, and Jackie, John Jr. and Caroline spent a full, secret day at the White House, including a dinner in the family quarters with the Nixons and their daughters.Afterward, there were thank-you notes. From an adolescent John on his monogrammed stationery: “I can never thank you more for showing us the White House. I really liked everything about it. You were so nice to show us everything, I don’t think I could remember much about the White House but it was really nice seeing it all again. I really loved the dogs, they were so funny. As soon as I came home my dogs kept on sniffing me. Maybe they remember the White House.” And from a teenage Caroline on her hot-pink version: “It was so nice to see it all again.”Related slideshow: The first ladies of the United States >>>Jackie Kennedy also thanked Pat Nixon: “Can you imagine the gift you gave us to return to the White House privately with my little ones when they were still young enough to rediscover their childhood? A day I always dreaded turned out to be one of the most precious ones I have spent with my children. May God bless you all. Most gratefully, Jackie.”Jackie Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson:Kennedy also kept up a correspondence, and a close bond, with Johnson, who was with her on the day her husband was assassinated in Dallas, in Johnson’s home state.Johnson to Kennedy at the opening of the John F. Kennedy Library in 1979:“This has to be both a proud day and an emotionally exhausting day for you. … Do remember that there are so many people wishing you happiness and contentment. Count me among them.”Jackie Kennedy called Lady Bird Johnson after President Johnson’s death in 1973, and Johnson wrote to thank her for her call: “These have been emotion-packed days, but there is still a feeling of insulation from the deep sadness I am sure must come. You know all too well how the responsibilities come crowding in.”Then, when Kennedy was diagnosed with cancer in 1994, Johnson wrote: “Do know that you have an army of friends — known and unknown — who care very much about you.”The women supported each others’ causes.Former first ladies, from left, Rosalynn Carter, Barbara Bush, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan and Hillary Rodham Clinton attend a gala saluting Betty Ford and the Betty Ford Center, Jan. 17, 2003, in Indian Wells, Calif. (Photo: Reed Saxon/AP)Johnson donated thousands of dollars to the Betty Ford Center, which treats addiction, and wrote to Ford: “Not long ago I came across a mutual friend of ours who told me quite straight-forwardly that she decided to face up to a drinking problem and to overcome it. She is so much more fun to be around these days!”Johnson to Nancy Reagan after the Reagans went public about President Reagan’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis: “It will be a comfort to others whose families have been afflicted, to know that it is no respecter of fame or importance.”There are also examples in the letters of the first ladies, current and former, using their clout.Johnson wrote directly to President Clinton asking him to pardon her friend, Texas banker Ruben Johnson, who had been convicted of bank fraud. “To use an old-fashioned word, Ruben is very much a gentleman,” she wrote. His was one of many pardons issued as Clinton left office.Barbara Bush and Betty Ford worked together to help a young Soviet girl whom Ford had brought to Bush’s attention. “I do not know if there is hope for little Diana Mowsesjan, but I will forward to the appropriate office with the hope that maybe there can be,” Bush wrote in 1990. (Andersen Brower says she could find no record of what help was sought for the girl, or what became of the request.)And sometimes there are examples of how some secrets are stronger than even the sorority.Lady Bird Johnson brought her grown daughters to the White House on the occasion of the dedication of an LBJ memorial in Washington, and Betty Ford showed them around the private quarters. Photos released later showed that there was a small, black suitcase at the edge of the Ford’s bed, packed and ready for Ford’s departure to the hospital for a mastectomy. That news would not be made public until later that day, and during their time together Ford didn’t mention it.The next day, Johnson wrote: “You were so calm and hospitable to us last Friday that it shocked the four of us even more than the rest of the nation when we heard the news that you had gone to the hospital. All of our collective mouths dropped. We were dumbfounded.”Says Andersen Brower: “If anyone would have understood the need to change the schedule, it would have been another first lady. But Betty Ford didn’t say a word.”The notes Andersen Brower most wants to read are those that started her on this book in the first place — those from Michelle Obama. But those likely won’t be public until this administration ends and there is a Presidential Library to put them in. Andersen Brower expects that Michelle Obama’s deepest bond with another first lady will be revealed to be with Laura Bush, despite the very different ideologies of their husbands.After the 2008 election, Michelle Obama’s chief of staff sat with Laura Bush’s for hours, Andersen Brower writes, and “Michelle’s staff was given what amounted to a blueprint, as Laura’s staff told them what missteps they had made along the way, which parties and luncheons were important, and which could be safely skipped.”Andersen Brower quotes Michelle Obama as saying at a conference last year: “It has made my transition to this office so much easier having somebody like Laura and her team. It’s that kind of sharing that prevents us from re-creating the wheel, allows us to build on the things that are already working so that the country gains as we transition from one party,” and one first lady, “to the next.”"
Trumphobia: The American traveler’s guide to dealing with embarrassing questions,1692,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: APThe woman, a retired schoolteacher from San Diego, was sitting with a friend in an almost empty restaurant in Civitavecchia, a seaside town not far from Rome. She had recently left a Mediterranean cruise, a ship full of Australians and Europeans, and was happy to discover that the only other couple in the dining room that evening was American.“At least,” she said, “I don’t have to defend Donald Trump to you.”You’re looking forward to your trip to Europe this summer. Thanks to an improving American economy, foreign travel by Americans is projected to increase almost 6 percent in 2016, in the face of fears about overbooked flights, terrorist attacks and exotic viruses. But those are familiar worries. The new and worrisome risk with traveling abroad in 2016 is being asked about Donald Trump. His suspicion of foreigners is matched by their fascination with him. Whatever your own feelings about him, you will likely find yourself on the defensive.At least since Charles Dickens visited the U.S. in 1842, Europeans have been amused, baffled and even frightened by American politics — a realm, Dickens wrote, of “despicable trickery at elections, under-handed tamperings with public officers, cowardly attacks upon opponents” and other deplorable behaviors that fill an entire chapter of “American Notes.” It’s a shame the author lived in a different century than Donald Trump, who was recently called “a great Dickensian character” by no less a literary and political critic than Sylvester Stallone. Dickens could have paid off all his debts by filling the insatiable European demand for Trumpiana.“On the whole, the Trump phenomenon is getting equal attention in the U.K. as in the U.S., if not more,” says Matthew Reading-Smith, 29, a native of Michigan who has been living and working in London for five years and was back home last over Thanksgiving. “Wherever I am, whenever someone notices my American accent, they ask me about Donald. I’m being asked to justify the country I come from.” Trump, he says, “strikes fear into the liberal values of Europe” and threatens, in the minds of Europeans, the special trans-Atlantic relationship that has been a cornerstone of the international order for decades.“Even Republicans,” says Cathal Gilbert, 35, an Irish citizen who works in international human rights in London. “And I do know a few who work in human rights, even they are appalled. They bury their faces in the salad bowl if I dare bring him up.” To understand the Trump phenomenon, Gilbert says, he went on YouTube for a few hours to watch his speeches. “When you listen to him, he makes a certain amount of sense to the audience he’s talking to. It’s not cogent, but it’s compelling.”SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>“For a long time, I had it easy,” says Tor Hodenfield, a 28-year-old Brooklyn native who has lived in Africa and in Switzerland and is now a graduate student at University College London. “I was an American, I was representing Barack Obama, everything was cool. Since Trump came on the scene, all that’s changed.” In fact, Obama himself has this problem, telling reporters last week, “I am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made” by Trump, and also his rival Sen. Ted Cruz, whom Obama described as “just as Draconian when it comes to immigration.” (Hillary Clinton said last month that she has been asked by the leaders of other countries whether they can endorse her to stop Trump. She hasn’t identified the countries.)There are no easy answers here. You might have to change tables once or twice during your cruise, or affect a British or Australian accent (best not to try this around Brits or Australians, obviously), or simply throw up your hands, as the San Diego woman did, and say, “Don’t look at me; I don’t get it either.” But as a public service, Yahoo News has a few suggestions for how to deflect questions — earnest, puzzled, well-intentioned or hostile — from citizens of other countries where candidates don’t seek office by boasting about their sexual endowments.“So’s your old man.” This won’t actually win any arguments, but it can at least change the subject, and there’s some satisfaction in pointing out that Trump’s eccentricities are not without precedent in Europe. Silvio Berlusconi, the billionaire media mogul who was off-and-on prime minister of Italy between 1994 and 2011, was also given to extravagant displays of bad taste and sexual braggadocio. England wrote the book on this kind of ruler, admittedly in the 16th century, with King Henry VIII — if you think Trump is hard on women, at least he hasn’t beheaded any of his wives. More seriously, the last few years have seen an upsurge in support for various nativist, nationalist, anti-immigrant parties in Western Europe, notably Marine Le Pen’s National Front, in France, and the United Kingdom Independence Party, which is pushing for Britain to leave the European Union, attracting “the same kind of Anglo-Saxon ethnic pride” that Trump is tapping into, says Reading-Smith. “Ever hear of Bernie Sanders?” Hodenfield likes to use this when he’s cornered on the subject of Trump, invoking the democratic socialist senator whose platform of universal health care and free college should win accolades from Western Europeans. The problem is, most of them have not heard of Sanders, whereas Trump is an all-pervasive presence in most European media. “My landlady’s Polish housekeeper barely speaks English,” Hodenfield says. “I doubt she knows who Hillary Clinton is — but she knows all about Trump.”“It’s all a put-up job.” Reading-Smith says he has tried to plant the idea that the Trump candidacy is actually a stealth operation to elect a Democrat by sabotaging the Republican Party with an unelectable candidate. Early on, a few Republicans said the same thing, semiseriously. Reading-Smith means it as a joke, of course. But no one is laughing now."
Sanders aide says the Clintons are showing their frustration,1520,"Jeff Weaver, campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders, at campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vt. (Photo: Brian Snyder/Reuters)Jeff Weaver, campaign manager for Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid in the Democratic primary, believes the Vermont senator’s opponent and her husband are on edge.Speaking to Yahoo News after the Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, N.Y., Weaver said he believes there has been a certain “edginess” in the Clinton campaign in the last few weeks, given that Sanders has won eight of the last nine primary contests.“I think that their campaign never believed that they would be in the position they’re in right now, having to contest New York. I mean, they clearly thought that they would have everything wrapped up by now. They clearly said it: ‘We’re going to have it wrapped up by February, we’re going to have it wrapped up by March,’” Weaver said. “And it’s not wrapped up, and I think they’re very, very frustrated about it.”Weaver said this tension was evident in a confrontation Hillary Clinton had with a woman who questioned her at an event late last month and and a testy exchange her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had with Black Lives Matter activists on April 7.“It was reflected in the secretary’s outburst at the young woman on the rope line. I think it was reflected in President Clinton’s outburst to Black Lives Matter activists. … There’s like an edginess to their campaign that’s sort of going all through it. And I think it’s a function of the fact that they are in a place they wish they weren’t,” Weaver said.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>Despite Sanders’ recent winning streak, Clinton’s victories earlier in the primary process have given her a pledged delegate lead so large that Sanders would need to win all the remaining contests by a wide margin to be able to beat her. The RealClearPolitics poll average shows Clinton has a 13.8 point lead in the New York primary, which will be held on April 19.Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, told Yahoo News he is comfortable about her position.“In terms of the race to get the nomination, it’s less a question of how much does Hillary win by, than how much should Sanders be winning by, if he has any hope of catching up to her in the nomination fight,” Mook said. “The fact is, you know, he would need to win New York by 20 or more points to even be in a position to try to capture the nomination. … If he loses, that path is really diminished quite a bit.”"
"Sanders warns of ‘drought and floods and extreme weather,’ criticizes Clinton on climate change",2167,"On any number of issues, the Hillary Clinton camp stresses that her policies are realistic and attainable. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ message, in turn, is that his vision is sweeping and aspirational. Those contrasting messages were highlighted by the back-and-forth on climate change Thursday night during the CNN Democratic presidential primary debate in Brooklyn.Clinton described working for years in Congress to “get rid of subsidies for big oil” and about the “transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.” She was proud of helping to negotiate the Paris Agreement on climate change signed by 195 countries, she said, and was disappointed that Sanders criticized it for not going far enough.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>At which point Sanders once again criticized it for not going far enough. “Of course the agreement is a step forward,” he said. “But … we have got to get beyond paper. We have to lead the world in transforming our energy system not tomorrow but yesterday.”He added: “When we look at climate change, we have got to realize this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency. … We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There’s gonna be international conflict.”Cover thumbnail photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"
Anti-Trump protests in New York City,2230,"Several hundred people gathered in New York to demonstrate against Donald Trump outside the Manhattan hotel hosting the Republican presidential frontrunner and his rival candidates at a lavish gala.The crowd held up posters comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler and accused him of being racist and anti-immigration amid a heavy police presence.“No Trump, no racism, immigrants are welcome here!” members of the gathering shouted. “New York is a no hate zone!” another slogan said.“The GOP platform is hate and fear,” said Jason Hurd, a former soldier who founded the pacifist movement Iraq Veterans Against the War, referring to the Republican Party.

Clinton to Sanders: Gun control is ‘not a laughing matter’,3112,"As they have in nearly every debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply over the subject of guns.It started with the question of whether Clinton had “seriously” blamed Vermont, and by extension Sanders, for New York’s gun violence, because earlier in the week, she did point out that most of the guns used in crime in New York came from other states, specifically his.“Of course not,” she said, but when Sanders chuckled, she became more than serious. “It’s not a laughing matter. Ninety people a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.”The two then clashed on all facets of gun control policy. Clinton noted that Sanders voted against the Brady Bill and for granting immunity from liability to gun makers and dealers. Sanders responded that he lost his first congressional campaign because of his support of an assault-weapons ban. Clinton said that the reason he won his next race was because he promised the NRA he would vote against waiting periods to buy weapons.Much of the back-and-forth at the CNN Democratic presidential primary debate in Brooklyn was familiar, but in the midst of it, Clinton pressed a line that has gotten less attention. Asked about whether Sandy Hook parents should be able to sue those who advertise and sell weapons, or whether manufacturers should be immune from such lawsuits, she said: “This is the only industry in America that has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Sen. Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street. … But what about the greed and recklessness of the gun manufacturers and dealers in America?”Cover thumbnail photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"
Clinton vs. Sanders: It’s all about the ‘judgment’,773,"The first word out of the gate at the Democratic debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on Thursday was the one both campaigns have been using a lot lately — “judgment.”Bernie Sanders began by questioning whether his opponent had it. “Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be our president? Of course she does,” he said, attempting to separate résumé from philosophy.“But I do question her judgment. I question the judgment that voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement, which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs, and I question her judgment about super-PACs, which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests… I don’t believe that is the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.”Hillary came storming back, defending her judgment. “Sen. Sanders did call me unqualified,” she said. “I’ve been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first,” she continued, to laughter. “Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator … and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of state for the United States.”She then pivoted to the issue that everyone was anticipating, the awkward interview Sanders gave to the New York Daily News last week. “Talk about judgment,” she said, “and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue: breaking up the banks… He could not explain how that would be done. … I think you need to have the judgment on Day 1 to be both president and commander in chief.”Cover thumbnail photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"
Paul Ryan says Middle East allies thanked him for taking on Trump,1568,"House Speaker Paul Ryan visits the the Iron Dome missile defense system in Israel on his recent trip to the Middle East. (Photo: IDF Spokesperson Unit) Fresh from a trip to the Middle East, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Thursday that American allies in the region — including Israel — thanked him for taking on Donald Trump over his call to bar Muslim immigrants from the United States.“When you see our beliefs, our values — and conservatism’s principles — being disfigured, you have to speak out,” Ryan said. “People over there knew about it and thanked me for doing it.”Asked whether that included Israel, the speaker replied: “Yeah.”Ryan aides had officially arranged the roughly 40-minute breakfast session to discuss his first overseas trip since assuming the speaker’s mantle, a voyage that took him to Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. But Ryan used the back-and-forth to lay out an election-year vision for the Republican Party’s foreign policy — one at odds with what he called President Obama’s “massive retrenchment” and Trump’s “Fortress America” unilateralism but also the military interventionism of George W. Bush.“I am not a neocon,” Ryan said firmly, using the shorthand most often associated with the group of conservative foreign policy thinkers who strongly advocated for going to war to remove Saddam Hussein from power.America can advance its values “without toppling and kicking over dictators and putting boots on the ground,” he said.The Wisconsin lawmaker accused Obama of leaving a dangerous “vacuum” in the Middle East and improving Iran’s standing at the expense of its regional rival, and traditional U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia.“Our allies want to know that we’re still in the game. Our allies are concerned that America is experiencing Middle East lethargy … Middle East fatigue,” Ryan said.But he coupled those frequent Republican complaints about the president with a cautious foreign policy vision of his own — one in which America champions its values overseas while staying “realistic” about its ability to shape other societies and builds a powerful military that it only uses sparingly, with full awareness of the potentially disastrous consequences of bad planning.“I believe we need to be consistent in professing our values,” he said. “At the same time, we have to be realistic about how far those values can be pushed.”And, Ryan said, “I do believe that the U.S. has an important role to play in help keeping the global commons safe, secure, so that it can be prosperous.“That’s why I think we need to have a reinvestment in our military. Not for the sake of using the military, but for the sake of having such a strong military that it is less likely to be used.”Military interventions “are never clean and easy,” Ryan warned.“We are really good at winning the front end of these things, but the back end has a huge tail that you have to be really committed to,” he added. “And I think we dropped our guard on Afghanistan and the situation deteriorated. And you know the story on Iraq. You have to think of these conflicts as very long-lasting, big-time commitments. They’re not quick, they’re not clean, they’re not antiseptic.”With mounting annoyance, the former vice presidential candidate has repudiated persistent speculation that he aims to set himself up as the Republican Party’s savior in the chaotic 2016 campaign, perhaps by winning the nomination at a contested convention in July.But if he won’t be the GOP’s candidate this year, he appears to be casting himself as its standard-bearer, prepared to help down-ballot candidates with money and messaging at a time when Republican elders worry that nominating Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz will spell defeat in close races come November.Ryan spoke at length about encountering deep concerns from officials in Israel and Saudi Arabia alike about Obama’s agreement with Iran to curb that nation’s atomic ambitions. But the speaker did not explicitly call for ripping up the accord, which offered Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in return for steps to dismantle its nuclear programs.Instead, Ryan called for taking a tougher line on Iran over its ballistic missile tests and trying to roll back efforts by major U.S. companies like Boeing to engage Tehran in hopes of doing business once international sanctions related to the Islamic republic’s nuclear programs melt away.“I worry that so much toothpaste is going to get out of the tube that we’re not going to be able to put much back in,” he said. “And I do believe that, next year, with a new government, we need to put as much of this toothpaste back in the tube as we can.”While he offered few precise, concrete proposals of his own, Ryan highlighted one of the difficult trade-offs inherent to presidential tradecraft as he described a long meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Sisi’s government has cracked down sharply on dissent and non-governmental organizations.Ryan said he had delivered the message that “you make it more difficult for us to be supportive of you when you have so many human rights violations.”But Ryan also said that Sisi views his chief mission as keeping Egypt stable, and said that “our worst nightmare” is seeing failed states in the Middle East become breeding grounds of terrorism.The speaker, who has stayed publicly neutral in the battle for the Republican nomination, refused to say which 2016 candidate he was closest to on foreign policy.“Come on, man,” he said with an eye roll and a laugh. “I was born at night, but not last night.”"

Like the Bull Moose, the Big Dog was unusually young (only 54) and still popular when he finished his presidency. He established his base in New York, about 100 blocks from where Roosevelt was born.For a while there was even talk of Clinton running for mayor, as Roosevelt once had. What a spectacle that would have been.Looking back now, though, the comparison seems wildly off. Roosevelt, you may recall, ended up running for president again and then crusading against Woodrow Wilson’s pacifism. To the day he died in 1919, TR jealously protected his twin legacy of reform and internationalism.Clinton, on the other hand, has run from every big ideological fight like a man on parole. From the moment he stepped out of the White House, the husband of a newly elected senator, his own political interests have been subservient to his wife’s.Sure, he started a foundation and got crazy rich, but for the last 16 years — a period in which much of what he achieved has been steadily distorted and discredited — Clinton has been chained by the role of dutiful political spouse.And so this is what it’s come to, as the most talented campaigner of the modern age apologizes for defending his own record and stumps cautiously for Hillary ahead of next week’s New York primary. What was supposed to be the final validation of Bill Clinton’s legacy inside the Democratic Party — the election of his wife as a successor — has now become the only thing left that can save it.To be clear, Clinton’s governing legacy, unlike Roosevelt’s, featured little by way of transformative legislation. Though he presided over a surging economy, Clinton’s presidency played out mostly like a tragedy in three acts: first the stumble over health care; then the survival of Republican rule through compromise; and finally the sex scandal that crippled his second term.Whatever lasting achievements Clinton might have claimed as world leader were probably washed away eight months after he left office, when the sudden strike of terrorists exposed a glaring failure of his tenure.But Clinton’s more lasting political legacy — the thing for which he should have been remembered — was the transformation of the Democratic Party from a tired, marginalized coalition of interest groups to a governing entity that embraced modern realities.As I was recently reminded watching “Crashing the Party,” an  upcoming documentary about the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council in the 1980s, Democrats by 1992 had lost five of the previous six presidential elections and were losing ground everywhere else. They were perceived, fairly, as reflexively anti-military and anti-business.Clinton’s central argument, which it took no small amount of courage to make in those early days, was that in order to both win and govern effectively, Democrats had to stop agitating for an ever more expansive government and start trying to build a better one.That was the philosophy that underlay Clinton’s string of pragmatic achievements: free trade, a balanced budget, welfare reform, the crime bill. For a while, anyway, it seemed like he had left an indelible stamp on the party, widening its focus from the poor and excluded to encompass the broader middle class.Except then came the Iraq War and the collapse of Wall Street, a crushing recession followed by an even more crushing recession and soaring inequality. Angry liberal populism reemerged as a powerful force, first in Howard Dean’s insurgency and then through the reborn John Edwards and now Bernie Sanders.At first, both Clintons tried gamely to defend the underpinnings of what became known as Clintonism. “I think that if ‘progressive’ is defined by results, whether it’s in health care, education, incomes, the environment, or the advancement of peace, then we had a very progressive administration,” Clinton told me during an interview in 2006 for my first book, on Democratic politics.When I had lunch with him in South Carolina the next year, while working on a cover piece for the New York Times Magazine about his legacy, Clinton readily agreed to talk more about it. By then, though, Hillary Clinton’s aides had decided that the more Bill went on about his own centrist legacy, the less helpful he became. They promptly quashed the interview.Now, some eight years later, the DLC is long dead (succeeded by a group called Third Way), and Clinton’s legacy inside his own party is savaged as never before. He’s derided on the left as a shill for Wall Street, a racist for supporting mass incarceration, a conservative for overhauling welfare.Clinton refuses to defend his own record at any length, and when he can’t help himself and plunges in anyway — as he did in rightly defending the crime bill to a couple of activists last week — he almost immediately retreats.It’s hard now to escape the conclusion that Clinton did not ultimately transform his party, the virus of Clintonism having been expelled from its bloodstream. Ordinary Democrats still love the former president, but the Democratic leaders and activists reject pretty much everything he stood for.In politics, you see, timing is everything. Bill Clinton arrived on the scene at a time when Democrats were desperate and dispirited, and they were willing to entertain any argument that might reverse their string of losses, even if it clashed with their own dogma.Hillary never had that luxury. She’s trying to fend off her own Jerry Brown circa 1992 at a time when Democrats have been winning presidential elections, and winning parties tend to care a lot about ideological purity. She can’t have Bill out there excoriating populism and protectionism.Maybe this is Bill Clinton’s penance — the price he pays for having humiliated his wife so publicly in 1998. Maybe in order to salvage what remained of his presidency and his marriage, he ultimately had to be willing to sacrifice his own case for historical relevance.Maybe this is why Clinton seems so much older all of a sudden, the white hair more brittle, the eyes more watery, the cranelike movements of the arms slower and more deliberate. You can imagine how all that forced silence takes its toll, how physically ruinous it must be to keep the fury inside, when all you want to do is defend yourself.What we know is that if Hillary Clinton goes on from New York to win the nomination, it will have more to do with the Obama record than with her husband’s. And if she’s elected in November, it won’t validate Bill’s legacy so much as offer him some path to redemption.Bill Clinton once argued to me that Teddy Roosevelt didn’t see his own progressive legacy affirmed for 24 years after he left office, when his distant cousin, Franklin, was elected with the same name and a similar platform. That may or may not be a sound interpretation of history.But you can see why it’s a comforting thought."
"Campaign rhetoric inspires chaos, anxiety in classrooms around the country",3656,"A Catholic bishop in Indiana denounced the Andrean High School students who waved a picture of Donald Trump and shouted “Build a wall!” at their opponents from a largely Hispanic school in nearby Hammond, Feb. 26, 2016. (Photo: Jonathan Miano/The Times via AP) Barbie Garayua Tudryn first noticed that the presidential election was having an unusual effect on the students at Frank Porter Graham Elementary back in September.Tudryn, who has been the guidance counselor at the English-Spanish bilingual school in Chapel Hill, N.C., since 2008, usually kicks off each school year with a lesson on diversity.“The kids were different this year,” Tudryn told Yahoo News. “As soon as I brought up the topic of how we’re all different and how our school represents so many pieces of the puzzle, the kids started talking about their own skin colors. From there they were saying, “If Trump wins, all the brown people will be taken out.”As the primaries have progressed, Tudryn said, those kinds of ideas have only become more ingrained in the students at Frank Porter Graham — 55 percent of whom are Latino. Tudryn said she’s seen kindergarteners shiver with fear upon hearing the word “Trump,” and watched third-grade classrooms devolve into utter chaos at the mere mention of the election.While previous presidential elections have typically been incorporated into the third-, fourth- and fifth-grade civics lessons, now, Tudryn said, “The teachers don’t even want to go there because they know it’s going to turn into a major mess.”“They’re afraid of losing control or getting an email from a  parent or getting accused of talking about politics in class,” she continued. “It’s unfortunate, it’s part of our job we need to teach this, but the [candidates’] rhetoric is not making it possible.”Tudryn is one of thousands of educators from around the country who are concerned about the negative impact the current presidential primary appears to be having on their students, according to a new report from the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Tolerance project, which aims to promote diversity and acceptance in schools. Disturbed by recent reports of Indiana high schoolers chanting “Build a wall!” during a basketball game against a largely Hispanic team, or third graders in Virginia warning their “immigrant” classmates that they’ll be sent home when Trump is elected, researchers at the Teaching Tolerance project set out to learn more about how this historically unconventional campaign is affecting America’s youngest citizens.    “We realized there’s no real source of data,” Maureen Costello, the project’s director, told Yahoo News. “Rather than speculate about it, we decided to ask our wealth of teachers.”Costello and her team crafted a survey and distributed it to their large network of K-12 educators via their email newsletter as well as the Teaching Tolerance website. More than 2,000 teachers from every state in the country responded, and while Costello said she wasn’t exactly surprised by the responses, “on the other hand, they shocked me.”  According to the report released Wednesday, more than two-thirds of the teachers surveyed said that many of their students — particularly those who are either Muslim, Latino, or first-generation Americans — have expressed “fear that they or their parents will be deported — or worse — after the election.”While the report finds that “children of color, in particular, are being deeply traumatized,” Costello notes that other students appear to be “emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric” heard on the campaign trail. More than a third of teachers reported hearing an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant comments, and more than half say their students have become increasingly unable to engage in civil political discourse.Worried about maintaining control over their classrooms, more than 40 percent of the teachers surveyed said they are reluctant to discuss the election in class.This, Costello said, is particularly concerning. Not only does such anxiety and classroom chaos prevent kids from learning, she explained, but by avoiding the conversation, teachers are actually depriving their students of one of the key lessons used to “grow kids into citizens in this country.”“They’re not learning what it means to self-govern, and that really bothers us,” she said.Though the survey did not refer to any specific candidates by name, comments from the teachers surveyed overwhelmingly cited Donald Trump more than any other presidential candidate.  That’s certainly the case at Frank Porter Graham Elementary, where Tudryn said, “all you hear is Trump this, Trump that.”Tudryn suggested that may be due in part to the fact that the Republican frontrunner’s last name “is kind of catchy for little kids.” But she also knows that many of the children whose parents speak Spanish at home are exposed to Telemundo and Univision, TV channels whose Spanish-language election coverage is often particularly critical of Trump.Despite the fact that approximately 90 percent of the Latino students at her school are documented, Tudryn said that a lot of their fear surrounding the election stems from a lack of understanding about what that means. A big part of quelling those students’ concerns involves helping them understand that their citizenship is no different from that of their fellow students.Another part of that effort involves educating students — and their parents — on how the U.S. electoral process works, something Tudryn has found especially crucial for the children of immigrants from countries with volatile political systems like Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.“In their parents’ minds, anything can happen,” Tudryn said. “But if your kid is a citizen and you are not a citizen, what you communicate to your child is critical to them having citizen ownership and feeling like a part of the United States.”Latino children are hardly the only ones taking Trump’s inflammatory words to heart. Teachers who responded to the survey reported observing similar anxieties among their Muslim and African-American students, reinforcing the fear first outlined by Washington Post columnist Petula Dvorak last month that “it may take an entire generation to recover from the hateful rhetoric [Trump has] aimed at immigrants, Muslims and Black Lives Matter protesters.” Trump, for his part, has emphatically dismissed the suggestion that he is to blame for young kids repeating language heard at his campaign rallies to taunt their Muslim or Latino classmates. But just last week in Wisconsin, several black and Latina high school soccer players were reportedly driven to walk off the field at a game by chants of “Donald Trump, build that wall!” from white fans of the opposing team. Tudryn knows for sure that if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee “we’re not going to have any option but to address this,” but she is comforted by the fact that she works at a bilingual school where both students and their parents “can come in and feel supported.”“I am so worried about the schools that don’t have any staff that speak Spanish or don’t understand what it’s like to be an immigrant in this country,” she said. “I cannot even begin to think how isolating it must feel to be in those schools with no Latino staff. That’s scary.”"
South Carolina: A case study in how Trump is being driven crazy,1196,"Donald Trump campaigns in Myrtle Beach, S.C., in February. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)Donald Trump continued this week to lose ground to Sen. Ted Cruz in the race for second-ballot delegates, whose votes will matter in a contested convention. In the latest setback, a caucus in one of the seven congressional districts in South Carolina picked delegates who are likely to support Cruz if the national convention goes to multiple ballots. The process illustrates the complex system by which delegates are actually chosen in many states, which Trump, a political novice without a strong national organization, has been denouncing as rigged against him.The three Republican delegates from the state’s fourth district are, like all 50 South Carolina delegates, bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot, based on his win in the state’s primary in February.However, if the national convention isn’t settled on the first ballot, it looks likely that many of the 50 delegates from the Palmetto State would desert Trump, who came in first in the primary, but with only 33 percent of the vote. The national convention will go to multiple ballots if Trump does not win at least 1,237 delegates out of the 2,472 available from 50 states, six U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. Currently, Trump has 743 delegates to Cruz’s 545 and 143 for Kasich.However, South Carolina is not the only place Trump has failed to organize at the state level. He is facing delegate setbacks in Virginia, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Tennessee, Louisiana, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Wyoming, Washington State, Missouri, and California.In South Carolina, only 12 of the state’s 50 delegates have been chosen so far, counting the state party chairman, Matt Moore, and the state’s two members of the Republican National Committee, Glenn McCall and Cindy Costa, who serve automatically. Over the next few weeks, the remaining four congressional districts will caucus to choose three delegates each. Then on May 7, 870 delegates to the state convention will chose an additional 26 national convention delegates.Of the 12 picked so far, only one — Jerry Rovner of Georgetown County — is considered likely to keep voting for Trump beyond the first ballot. State insiders believe the other 11 will desert the New Yorker once they are no longer bound. And they say that’s likely to be true for many or most of the delegates yet to be named.The 870 state delegates were chosen a year ago at county conventions, which were preceded by county precinct meetings. A little over 3,000 people participated in the process of picking the 870 state delegates.“The majority of the people at the state convention are not Trump people,” said Tony Denny, who is a delegate to the state convention and has been a national delegate to the last three conventions.Denny, who served as rules chairman of the state party for four years, said that Trump supporters are “trying to get organized” but added: “I don’t get the sense there’s any big Trump movement underway.” Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz greets supporters in Seneca, S.C., in February. (Photo: Paul Sancya/AP)On Saturday, Trump lost five of six delegate slots to Cruz in two other congressional districts — the third and the seventh — in the Palmetto State. Four other congressional districts — the first, second, fifth and sixth — have yet to hold their nominating conventions.Trump won the South Carolina primary vote on Feb. 20, with 33 percent of the vote, to 22 percent for Sen. Marco Rubio, 22 percent for Cruz, 8 percent for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 8 percent for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and 7 percent for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Combining Trump’s share with the votes for Carson — who has dropped out and endorsed Trump — only gets to 40 percent; the remaining three-fifths of the Republican electorate either supported a candidate who is still running, or whose base doesn’t seem to overlap much with the New Yorker.And so far, Rovner is the only delegate openly committed to staying with Trump past the first ballot, though he added that “if it gets down to the point where we have to unify, I will unify. I’m not going to be an idiot.”Rovner expressed outrage that other delegates would switch their support away from Trump on multiple ballots.“These people, they’re hypocrites,” he said, noting that many delegates who are for Cruz or Kasich on a second ballot often complain to him that their representatives in Congress don’t listen to their constituents.Rovner rejected the idea that there was a conspiracy against Trump, or that delegates were being siphoned away by corruption. The United States, he said passionately, is “a republic, not a democracy.” But he added that if Trump doesn’t get all of South Carolina’s 50 delegates to stick with him, then voters who supported Trump will be sent a message that their vote doesn’t matter.“The system is not rigged,” he said. But Rovner said that Democrats who “crossed over” to vote for Trump in the Republican primary “don’t get represented at all by either party.”“The only people who can be delegates are those who work within the system. I feel a higher calling to represent those people who don’t participate because they’re too busy or choose not to,” Rovner said."
Politics reporter quits newspaper owned by Ivanka Trump’s husband after it endorses Donald Trump,1500,"Ross Barkan standing in front of New York’s City Hall. (Photo: Najib Aminy/Courtesy of Ross Barkan)The sole national political reporter at the New York Observer announced he would leave the paper after three years in the wake of the paper’s endorsement of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, whose son-in-law, Jared Kushner, owns the Observer.The Trump endorsement, published online Tuesday evening, drew substantial criticism and became the second major controversy involving the paper’s relationship with the candidate in recent months.Ross Barkan, who does not have another job lined up, broke the news in a pair of tweets.“Personal news: I’m announcing today that my last day at the New York Observer will be April 27th,” Barkan wrote. “I’m grateful for the three years I’ve spent at NYO, and all the experiences I’ve had along the way. Most grateful to our readers.”In a conversation with Yahoo News shortly after he announced his departure from the paper, Barkan said it had become “increasingly difficult” to navigate the Observer’s Trump connection. Though Barkan was never explicitly told how to cover the election, he said he felt some pressure when he reported on Trump, the GOP presidential primary frontrunner.“Nothing that I wrote or reported was ever not what I wanted to do. There was never, like, ‘Go write this, you have to write this. … Every piece of reporting I did, I stand by it 100 percent,” Barkan said. “Were there things we couldn’t necessarily cover — or were there unspoken rules?… The policies and directions weren’t always clear. I didn’t always feel I could report to the fullest extent that I could.”Barkan said he stayed away from certain stories as a result of the Observer’s family ties.“Perhaps I was self-censoring myself or I felt they wouldn’t be welcomed by people above me,” Barkan said of potentially difficult Trump stories. “But there was never a point where I was directed to do anything.”Kushner, who purchased the Observer in 2006, is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka. In early 2013, Kushner tapped Ken Kurson to be the paper’s editor in chief. A family friend of Kushner’s, Kurson had a background in both journalism and politics. Kurson, who was a contributor to Esquire magazine, had been working at a Republican political consulting firm in New Jersey. He also served in the administration of former Republican New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Kurson worked as a consultant and speechwriter for Giuliani, including on the mayor’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid.Barkan, 26, started working at the Observer as an intern in late 2012. He became a full-time employee the following year. The Observer has long covered New York politics, but Barkan was named national political reporter earlier this year and hit the campaign trail for the paper.(Full disclosure: This reporter worked at the Observer from 2011 to 2013, and as senior politics editor supervised Barkan and worked under Kurson.)Kurson initially said there would be “no good way” for the Observer to cover Trump’s presidential bid given Kushner’s relationship to the candidate. However, as Trump surged to the front of the Republican primary pack, the paper began covering his campaign, which had become unavoidable and one of the top stories in America. Kurson said the Observer would “play it straight” when covering Trump, and the stories all included a disclosure statement. As the Observer’s sole national political reporter, Barkan wrote much of this Trump coverage.Last month, it was revealed that Kurson helped Trump craft a speech he delivered before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in late March. Kushner also helped write the address. Barkan, who wrote an article about the speech, was unaware that his boss had been involved in writing it until after he filed. He described this as “troubling” and the first of a series of “unforeseen incidents” that contributed to his decision to leave the paper.“It had become increasingly difficult,” Barkan said, adding, “I made my concerns clear.”Barkan said he spoke to Kurson after the incident and asked to be briefed on any other issues that might come up involving Trump. That did not happen, and Barkan said he was “surprised” when the paper’s Trump endorsement was published on Tuesday. As is typical for endorsements, it was written as an editorial. While the Observer’s editorial pages are written independently of the paper’s news operation, Barkan said he felt that he should have been given a heads-up based on the conversation he had with Kurson following the AIPAC speech. Barkan said this would have allowed him to “steel himself” for the onslaught of negative online attention that came in the wake of the endorsement.“The Observer has a right to endorse. They can do that. I have no issue with the newspaper endorsing Trump per se. He’s a presidential candidate. If that’s who you want to back, go do it,” Barkan said. “I personally did not know this was happening when it did. I was blindsided by it.”This was the straw that broke the camel’s back for Barkan, though he said the Observer’s connection to Trump wasn’t the sole factor in his decision to leave the paper.“That was a factor. I don’t want to say that was the only factor, because that wasn’t it,” said Barkan, adding, “I’d be lying if I said that this last month or so has been easy. It has not been easy given everything that’s happened.”In an email to Yahoo News, Kurson simply said the paper was “grateful” to Barkan “for his three years.” Barkan also expressed fondness for the Observer.“I don’t want to say the Observer can’t do national politics — that’s not fair. They may hire someone else. There may be adjustments, and it may work swimmingly,” Barkan said. “I hope it does, because the fate of the Observer is important. … It’s a place I still cherish despite everything. And they may be able to do national politics very well. I think for me it was no longer a place that made sense.”"
Donald Trump says he won’t attend White House Correspondents’ Dinner,2887,"In a blow to President Obama’s joke writers and C-SPAN’s ratings, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump says he will not attend the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner later this month.  Trump told the Hill newspaper that despite receiving invitations from “every single group of media available to mankind,” he’s decided not to go.Why not? The media can’t be trusted to describe his mood.“I would have a good time, and the press would say I look like I wasn’t having a good time,” Trump, who attended last year’s dinner before launching his presidential bid, explained. “The press is dishonest. If the press would be honest, I’d go because I’d have a good time. … But no matter how good a time I had, the press would say, ‘Donald Trump was miserable.’ What would I need that for?”The annual black-tie gala, dubbed the “nerd prom” by the Washington, D.C., press corps, is closer to a Friars Club roast than a high school dance. This year’s event, hosted by comedian Larry Wilmore, is scheduled for April 30.In 2011, Trump made an infamous appearance at the dinner, where he was mercilessly mocked by Obama, whose long-form birth certificate had just been released in response to the so-called “birther” movement championed by the reality show star.Donald Trump arrives for the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in Washington, D.C., on April 30, 2011. (Photo: Alex Brandon/AP/File)“Donald Trump is here tonight,” Obama said. “Now I know he’s taken some flack lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald. And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like, ‘Did we fake the moon landing?’ ‘What really happened in Roswell?’ and, ‘Where are Biggie and Tupac?’”“All kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience,” Obama told Trump. “In an episode of ‘Celebrity Apprentice,’ at the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so ultimately, you didn’t blame Lil Jon or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. Well handled, sir. Well handled.”Some have pointed to Trump’s humiliation at the 2011 correspondents’ dinner as a catalyst for his 2016 presidential bid.Trump, though, insists he wasn’t offended by Obama’s relentless zingers.“I had a great time. I was very honored by all of the attention,” he told the Hill. “The president told joke after joke, and it was good. They were all very nice and delivered nicely, and I had a great time and told the press. For four years, I’ve read what a miserable time I had.”"
Hillary Clinton blames NYC mayor for racially charged sketch,2721,"Leslie Odom Jr., from the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” Clinton and de Blasio perform during Saturday’s event. (David Handschuh/The Inner Circle via AP) Hillary Clinton is sidestepping the controversy over a racially charged comedy sketch she participated in during a gala hosted by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio over the weekend.“Well, look, it was Mayor de Blasio’s skit,” Clinton told Cosmopolitan magazine on Tuesday. “He has addressed it, and I will really defer to him because it is something that he’s already talked about.”During her appearance at the 94th annual Inner Circle Show in Manhattan on Saturday, the Democratic frontrunner appeared onstage in a prewritten sketch, poking fun at her trouble swiping a MetroCard and needling de Blasio over his late endorsement of her candidacy.“Sorry, Hillary, I was running on C.P. time,” de Blasio explained, appearing to reference “colored people time” — a term defined by Urban Dictionary as the stereotypical explanation given by African Americans “as a reason for being late to an event” or for “a traditionally black event not beginning on time.”“Hamilton” star Leslie Odom Jr., who also appeared in the sketch, was quick to object.“I don’t like jokes like that, Bill,” he said. “That’s not funny.”Clinton turned to Odom to clarify what de Blasio meant. “Cautious politician time,” she said. “I’ve been there.”The mayor’s office released a statement after the event saying the joke was aimed at him.“In an evening of satire, the only person this was meant to mock was the mayor himself, period,” the statement read. “Certainly no one intended to offend anyone.”And de Blasio himself defended the joke in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday night. “It was clearly a staged show,“ the mayor said. ""It was a scripted show. The whole idea was to do the counterintuitive and say, ‘cautious politician time.'”""Every actor involved — including Hillary Clinton and Leslie Odom Jr. — thought it was a joke on a different convention,” de Blasio continued. “That was the whole idea. I think people are missing the point here.”Whatever the intent, it was the second time in a week the Clinton campaign clashed with a black audience.Former President Bill Clinton exchanged words with Black Lives Matter protesters in Philadelphia, where he defended his wife’s 1996 characterization of black juvenile offenders as “super predators"" — a term she recently said he “shouldn’t have used.““I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children,” Bill Clinton said. “Maybe you thought they were good citizens; she didn’t. She didn’t.”“You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter,” he added."
Trump’s daughters and wife defend his treatment of women,2979,"Throughout the Republican presidential primaries, Donald Trump has had a strained relationship with female voters — thanks in part to his derogatory comments about women. He has called his critic Rosie O’Donnell a fat pig, disparaged Carly Fiorina’s looks and seemingly attributed Megyn Kelly’s hard questioning during a debate to her menstrual cycle. But during a Tuesday night CNN town hall discussion with the New York mogul’s family, his wife and daughters argued that these insults meant nothing in comparison to their own positive experiences with him.Asked by an audience member what they think about the media’s portrayal of Trump as insensitive to women, his daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and wife, Melania, came to his defense.“I think the facts speak for themselves,” Ivanka, who is the daughter of Trump’s first wife, said. “I’ve witnessed these incredible female role models that he’s employed in the highest executive positions at the Trump organization my entire life. And in an industry that has been dominated by men — is still dominated by men, but certainly was when he was starting out in his career —he was employing some of these women, and raising them through the ranks.”Tiffany, Trump’s 22-year-old daughter from his second marriage, to Marla Maples, said that she felt her father made no gender distinctions in offering encouragement.“Every time I speak to him on the phone, whether it be at school or when I’m with him in his office or in Palm Beach, he wants us to do the best,” she said. “He has the utmost faith that we can accomplish whatever we set our minds to, just as well as men, if not better.”As for Melania, she offered a much more cut-and-dried story of Trump’s approach to women.“He treats everyone equally,” she said. “If you’re a woman and they attack him, he will attack back, no matter who you are. We are all human, and he treats them equal as men.”"
This is what Donald Trump’s family thinks about his Twitter presence,80,"Donald Trump has tweeted hundreds of insults at people and places, and even gone after a Neil Young song. He’s retweeted comments by neo-Nazis and a supporter who shared an unflattering photo of Ted Cruz’s wife. But ask his family what they think about his social media presence, and they just laugh it off.During a Tuesday night town hall conversation with Trump, his wife, Melania, and his children Ivanka, Tiffany, Eric and Donald Jr., CNN host Anderson Cooper took a moment reflect on the reality TV star’s infamous tweets. “Are there some days you wake up and you look at Twitter and you think, really?,” Cooper asked the family, provoking a round of laughter. “It kind of makes him the person he is, honestly,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “It’s so great to not see the traditional politician sound bites that you read too often. He’s so authentic. He writes the tweets himself. He doesn’t have a team of hundreds of hundreds of people behind him, and I think that’s actually what makes him the great candidate that he is.”“Melania, do you ever want to say to him, put the mobile device down?” Cooper asked.“Anderson, if he would only listen,” she said. “I did many times. And I just say ‘OK, do whatever you want.’ He’s an adult, he knows the consequences.”Trump, who said he’d likely tweet very little if elected president, also revealed the process behind his tweets.“During the day I’m in the office,” he said. “I just shout it out to one of the young ladies who are tremendous office staff — Meredith, and some of the people that work for me — and I’ll just shout it out and they’ll do it. But during the evenings, after 7 o’clock or so, I will always do it by myself.”Excuse us while we pour one out for Meredith, who officially has one of the least appealing jobs in New York. "
Bill Clinton was already getting briefed about Trump running for president in 1999,464,"Donald Trump, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Pres. Bill Clinton at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., July 2008. (Photo: Sabo Robert/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)Pres. Bill Clinton received information to help him respond to questions about the prospect of Donald Trump mounting a presidential bid all the way back in 1999.Trump, now the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary, first flirted with a White House run during the 2000 election cycle, when Democratic presidential primary frontrunner Hillary Clinton was first lady and Bill occupied the Oval Office.Documents newly released by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library show that the famously loquacious Bill Clinton was prepped to talk Trump while still in the White House. Clinton received a memo about Trump ahead of a White House press conference in a document dated Oct. 14, 1999. Trump, a real estate mogul who has been a tabloid fixture in New York and regularly appeared on television even before launching his own reality show in 2008, was included among other unconventional celebrity candidates.The guidance for the press conference included a potential question about how “everyone from Warren Beatty to Donald Trump to Cybill Shepherd is contemplating a run for the White House.” White House staff prepared Clinton to respond critically to campaigning by boldface names, and to say that it “trivializes the importance of the office.” In response to questions about whether the president felt in any way responsible for that trend, Clinton was advised to answer as follows:“I think it may say something about the way the media covers politics these days, but I have the utmost confidence in the American people to sort out the wheat from the chaff. Regardless of who runs for president or how they’re covered, the public eventually sees through all the smoke and mirrors. And they, after all, have the ultimate power at the ballot box.”Clinton was again prepared by staff to take questions about Trump for an interview with Bryant Gumbel on the inaugural episode of CBS’ “The Early Show” in November 1999. In the briefing for that conversation, which was dated Oct. 29, 1999, a question about Trump was included as a follow-up to questions about the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Staff advised that Gumbel could ask Clinton about potential campaigns by Trump, Beatty and Shepherd, and whether they were “the result of a demeaning of the office that you’ve contributed to.”Clinton was advised once again to answer that people would be able to separate the “wheat from the chaff.” He was also prepped to deny his presidency led more celebrities to enter the fray.“I don’t think what I’ve done has anything to do with such political developments. We go through all sorts of cycles in politics, and we’re in one now, where some people from the entertainment world are talking about running for president,” the answer said. “That’s not a first, by the way. So, it’s a free country, people can chart their own course, and the political process will sort out the wheat from the chaff. I’m not concerned about it.”The guidance for the “Early Show” interview also suggested that Clinton should encourage people and the press not to focus on the cult of personality in the 2000 election.“What I am concerned about is whether we’ll get to focusing on the real issues out there — who is best prepared to take this country into the new century, who has the big ideas to meet the big challenges we face, who is equipped to bring about the kind of changes we all need in a rapidly changing country and world,” the suggested answer said. “There’s a natural tendency to cover this campaign on the basis of the various personalities involved, the latest poll numbers, the money game. But I hope we can do better at paying attention to what really matters.”In addition to these two briefings, the documents released by the Clinton library include other briefing materials that contain press coverage of Trump.There was also a document confirming that Clinton participated in a photo shoot with Trump at his Manhattan headquarters, Trump Tower, in 2000 and some brief discussion about whether Clinton should send letters to Trump on his 50th birthday and for an occasion at which he was being honored. In both cases, aides said the letters should not be sent. The documents released also included a copy of Trump’s book, “The Art of the Deal,” which he gave to Clinton aide Mark Middleton. Trump signed the book and wrote, “To Mark, Best Wishes … Your Mom Is the Best.”The Clintons and the Trumps had a variety of contacts before the 2016 campaign. Trump has donated to the Clintons and their charitable foundation. Bill and Hillary Clinton also attended Trump’s wedding in 2005, and their daughters have been friends.There were reports Clinton called Trump last spring and encouraged him to get involved in politics before the billionaire officially launched his presidential bid. Clinton’s office confirmed a conversation occurred last May, but it denied the election was discussed. Clinton was asked about the call by “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert last October. Colbert alluded to polling that shows Hillary Clinton would easily defeat Trump. Colbert said it would have been “pretty smart” for Clinton to encourage Trump to enter the race. Clinton said the conversation “wasn’t about running for office.”“His daughter told my daughter that he had tried to call me, and I didn’t get the message. So I simply called him back,” Clinton said. “And I don’t know whether he had ever intended to discuss this with me or not, and this has happened to you before, I bet, I think by the time I got him back, he had forgotten why he called me in the first place, probably.”"
House Speaker Ryan rules out presidential bid,591,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday definitively ruled out a bid for president this year, insisting that the party's choice should emerge from the group of candidates who pursued the GOP nomination. ""Count me out,"" he said.In a brief news conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters, the Wisconsin Republican sought to tamp down rampant speculation that he could end up as the party's standard-bearer if front-runner Donald Trump and the other candidates flame out at a contested convention.""We have too much work to do in the House to allow this speculation to swirl or have my motivations questioned,"" said Ryan, who was the 2012 vice presidential nominee. ""Let me be clear: I do not want, nor will I accept, the Republican nomination.""Ryan's comments come as a contested convention looks likelier by the day. Ryan and his aides have continually denied the speaker has presidential ambitions this year, but their statements have not put the issue to rest. That's partly because Ryan also denied he wanted to be speaker last fall after then-Speaker John Boehner announced his resignation, but he ended up with the job anyway.Tuesday's appearance was an attempt to shut down the speculation once and for all, and end what aides said has become a major distraction to Ryan's work as speaker. Yet it may not be enough to quiet the talk about Ryan, given the unpredictable twists of the GOP presidential primary.""So let me speak directly to the delegates on this: If no candidate has a majority on the first ballot, I believe you should only choose a person who actually participated in the primary. Count me out,"" Ryan said. ""I simply believe that if you want to be the nominee — to be the president — you should actually run for it. I chose not to. Therefore, I should not be considered. Period.""Trump looks unlikely to accumulate the necessary delegates to clinch the nomination ahead of the July Republican convention in Cleveland. That would allow his lead challenger, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, to make a play for the job. A third hopeful, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, trails in the delegate count.Yet party leaders fear neither the erratic Trump nor the polarizing Cruz could beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. They also fear the GOP won't be able to hold onto control of the Senate with Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket.So if neither Trump nor Cruz can get the delegate votes necessary as balloting progresses at the convention, chaos could result — and along with it, the potential for some other Republican who's not currently running to emerge. As a young and charismatic conservative, popular with donors and with some conservative activists, Ryan's name has been at the top of that list for months.Ryan is also seen as a possible candidate in 2020. Early in the campaign season he announced he would not be making a run in 2016, yet some of his own actions fueled the talk. He's delivered high-profile speeches calling for a more principled politics, and his staff uses social media to promote developments as varied as Ryan's recent trip to the Mideast and his decision to ""give up impatience and anxiety"" for Lent.Ryan insisted Tuesday that such moves have been aimed at communicating on behalf of House Republicans, though he has yet to unveil the policy proposals he's been promising. Removing the presidential speculation would put Ryan's focus squarely on his day job as the leader of the House, and he faces several key tests soon.In a long-brewing embarrassment, it's become plain that Ryan has all but given up hope of passing a budget for the upcoming budget year. Ryan orchestrated four budget efforts as chairman of the Budget Committee over 2011-2014 but now can't produce one as speaker. Boehner, his predecessor, presided over five successful budgets.Under the government's arcane budget law, the House is supposed to produce a budget by April 15. But a tea party revolt over Ryan's embrace of last year's bipartisan deal with President Barack Obama to increase spending by the Pentagon and domestic agencies has left him well short of the votes he needs.___Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor in Washington and Scott Bauer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, contributed to this report."
Obama gives U.S. women’s soccer an assist in pay dispute,2274,"Pres. Barack Obama welcomes the U.S. Women’s National Team to the White House last year. (Photo: mpi34/MediaPunch/IPX)Six months ago, Pres. Barack  Obama welcomed the U.S. women’s soccer team  to the White House to celebrate their World Cup championship, saying they had achieved “payback” for prior defeats. On Wednesday, he waded into the battle over the considerable difference in pay between men and women players.“Equal pay for equal work should be a fundamental principle of our economy,” Obama said at an event to highlight disparities in male and female wages. “It’s the idea that whether you’re a high school teacher, a business executive or a professional soccer player or tennis player, your work should be equally valued and rewarded, whether you are a man or a woman.”Five leading  stars of the United States women’s national team recently announced  that they had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), charging that they were paid considerably less than the men’s team.“I think that we’ve proven our worth over the years,” superstar Carli Lloyd told NBC’s “Today” show. “Just coming off of a World Cup win, the pay disparity between the men and women is just too large. And we want to continue to fight.” A similar gap exists in professional tennis.Asked whether the president was endorsing the soccer players’ EEOC complaint, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama was reflecting on “the facts” but underlined that “what sort of ruling is handed [down] by the EEOC is something that the commissioners there will have to conclude on their own.”Obama’s remarks came as he dedicated a new national monument to women’s equality on “Equal Pay Day,” an event meant to highlight disparities in income between men and women.Earnest said he was not familiar with the way the men’s and women’s soccer team pay is set, but that Obama was noting “that there is a significant disparity based solely on the gender of the players, and that seems unfair.”“That disparity and the inherent unfairness of that disparity, I think is pretty obviously to anybody who’s been paying attention,” Earnest said. “And the president’s been paying attention.”"
"Unconventional #1: The GOP’s veep problem, Cruz’s scheme to sink Trump in California, Sanders’ strange superdelegate shift (and more!)",7,"Photo: Larry Downing/Reuters  Unconventional is Yahoo News’ guide to the ins and outs of this year’s crazy presidential conventions. Here’s what you need to know today.  The GOP’s 2016 “veepstakes” is likely to be weirder than anything we’ve seen before.(For the full story, click here.)In a normal presidential election year, the parties tend to coalesce around their nominees long before the conventions. That, in turn, gives each standard-bearer several months to select a running mate. It’s all very polite and predictable.But 2016 is not a normal presidential election year — to put it mildly. If none of the candidates arrive at the convention in Cleveland with a majority of delegates (for the first time since 1984) and no candidate manages to cobble together a majority on the first ballot either (for the first time since 1952), it will means chaos, maneuvering and multiple rounds of presidential balloting — which in turn almost guarantees that the GOP’s 2016 vice presidential candidate will be chosen in one of five very odd ways.The first would be the Premature Pick — that is, a VP pick made before the party even chooses its presidential nominee. This is exactly what Ronald Reagan did when he selected Richard Schweiker in 1976. The former California governor was neck and neck with incumbent President Gerald Ford at the time, and his hope was that Schweiker, a moderate U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, would soothe fears about his Western conservatism and flip some middle-of-the-road delegates. If Trump, Cruz or Kasich were to name a running mate prior to the convention, they’d be jumping the gun for similarly self-serving reasons: to curry favor with the delegates who will ultimately decide their fate.The second, third and fourth scenarios would all unfold at the convention itself. There’s the Unity Ticket, in which the first- and second-place finishers band together for the good of the party. There’s the Rushed Running Mate: a new figure who joins the ticket either (a) during the balloting process in Cleveland, or (b) shortly after the nomination is decided on the floor of the convention hall. (Imagine the usual weeks-long rollout procedure, only this time compressed into the most hectic and pivotal hours of the entire 2016 GOP contest, when the candidates and their overextended advisers will not have had nearly as much time as earlier campaigns to consider their options and control the unveiling.) And it’s also possible that a majority of delegates could nominate the party’s 2016 veep candidate by themselves — no matter what the presidential candidates do, say or want. (Call it a Convention’s Choice).“That’s a subject no one’s really talking about, is that [the VP pick] is another vote on the floor,” RNC Chair Reince Priebus has said. “There’s no first- and second-ballot binding. It’s just a free vote.”Finally, the RNC rules committee could push for a Delayed Decision, revising its bylaws and deferring the final veep vote to a later date so that whoever emerges from Cleveland as the presidential nominee can take the time he needs to consider (and vet) his pick.All these scenarios are politically risky. A Premature Pick could look presumptuous — the equivalent of  Al Gore launching his transition effort before the courts had officially decided the 2000 election. It might also alienate other vice presidential hopefuls and their fans at the very moment you need all the support you can get, and it would certainly limit your leverage on the convention floor, where the vice presidency may be the only bargaining chip that can push you past the 1,237-delegate mark. In the antagonistic atmosphere of 2016, a unity ticket — especially Trump-Cruz — is unlikely to gel. A Rushed Running Mate could easily backfire (for lack of vetting) or hijack coverage at a time when the focus should be squarely on the candidate. A Convention’s Choice could highlight intraparty division; a Delayed Decision could be messy and confusing.Even worse? The GOP’s wacky veepstakes “might damage the vice presidency itself,” according Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who specializes in vice presidential history. “We haven’t seen anything like this in the modern era.”Want to know more?

I’ll RT the best/funniest/most “unconventional” predictions._____You may think this primary season feels a little like Wrestlemania. But it’s likely to turn into an all-out cage match at the Republican National Convention in July. What happens if no one clinches the nomination before Cleveland? Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric explains how a contested convention would work._____ Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz speaks during a campaign rally in Irvine, Calif., April 11, 2016. (Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)As we saw in Colorado — and North Dakota, and Louisiana, and elsewhere — Team Cruz is much, much better than Team Trump at understanding and taking advantage of each state’s distinctive primary or caucus rules to maximize its delegate tally.But in California — the last and largest primary on the calendar — Cruz’s strategic superiority won’t just help the Texan pick up a few extra delegates. It could actually prove to be the difference between Trump clinching the nomination outright or falling short at the 11th hour, which would trigger a contested convention.No wonder Cruz took a break Monday from campaigning in New York to visit Irvine and San Diego on his most extensive Golden State swing to date.“This is the birthplace of the Reagan revolution — and let me tell ya, there’s a new revolution brewing,” Cruz told thousands of supporters at the Hotel Irvine. “Just like in 1980, it’s gonna be California that’s gonna decide, California that’s gonna lead the way.”This isn’t just idle chatter. To secure the nomination on June 7, Trump will have to  win roughly 70 percent of California’s delegates. But the state’s primary is a little quirky — and all those quirks favor the senator from Texas.To find out more, Unconventional sat down after the Irvine rally with Mike Schroeder, the former state GOP chairman who’s now serving as Cruz’s political director in California.“This is the last stand,” Schroeder said. “This is the battleground. And I think we’re going to win California — but even if we don’t, Trump is not going to get to 70 percent of the vote.”Why is Schroeder so confident? First of all, only Republicans can cast ballots on June 7. No independents or Democrats. That’s good for Cruz (who does best with conservatives) and bad for Trump (who does best with moderates).Secondly, California is winner-take-all by congressional district (plus three unpledged delegates and an additional 10 that will be awarded to the statewide champ). Not only is this a boon for the most organized candidate; it also blunts the impact of expensive ad buys (contrary to the conventional wisdom about California campaigns). Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz greets supporters at a campaign rally on April 11, 2016, in Irvine, Calif. (Photo: David McNew/Getty Images)“It requires a great deal more organization to conduct 53 elections than it does to conduct one statewide and just buy a lot of TV,” Schroeder said. “This is very blue state. So we’ll have some districts with only 5,000 Republican voters. I call them ‘empty districts’: maybe 2,000 voters will decide the result. That’s not even a good-size city council race. And yet you still get the same number of delegates — three — that you would in a district with 240,000 Republicans.”The Cruz campaign has been organizing in California for a year. They have thousands of volunteers statewide. And an estimated 65 percent of primary participants are expected to vote early by mail — a process that begins in three weeks. “We’re going to talk to all of these people personally,” Schroeder said. “We can pour calls into those empty districts.”Also helping Cruz is the fact that the campaigns have to pick their own delegates — 169 of them, plus 169 alternates. The process of identifying six committed Cruz supporters in every single congressional district — including districts where Republicans haven’t really campaigned in decades — wasn’t easy. It took Schroeder five months. But now he’s finished — and the Trump campaign, which just hired a state political director today, is only getting started.“It’s been a huge project for me,” Schroeder said. “And they have to file all of those names with the secretary of state on May 7? That’s less than a month from now. If you don’t have those names by May 7, even if you win that district, you don’t get any delegates.”On Monday, Trump convention manager Paul Manafort  accused the Cruz campaign of using “Gestapo tactics” to earn delegate support. Schroeder chuckled when he heard that.“These are the rules,” Schroeder said. “They’re pretty simple. Follow them. Get over it. Stop whining.”In California, Schroeder and the rest of Team Cruz could have the last laugh._____Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders smiles during a campaign stop Wednesday, April 6, 2016, at Tindley Temple United Methodist Church in Philadelphia. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)For months, Bernie Sanders’ allies have been arguing that the Democratic Party’s superdelegates — who can vote for whomever they want at the convention — should not go against “the will of the people” and should instead back the candidate who won the most pledged delegates in their state.

Newly woke Mark Zuckerberg calls out Trump during Facebook conference,84,"Today, Facebook kicks off its sixth F8 developer’s conference, which usually means the announcement of a few new bells and whistles to the platform, plus some ambitious plans to take over the world. But before he could get to any of that, CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg got uncharacteristically political.“As I look around and I travel around the world, I’m starting to see people and nations turning inward, against this idea of a connected world and a global community,” he said in his opening keynote speech in San Francisco. “I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as ‘others.’ For blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade and, in some cases around the world, even cutting access to the Internet.”It’s pretty clear that by “voices,” Zuckerberg was passive-aggressively referring to Republican presidential primary frontrunner Donald Trump, who has called for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States and a defense strategy that would somehow shut down the Internet in Islamic State-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq.Zuckerberg then made it clear that he sees Trump’s policies as standing in direct conflict with Facebook’s “roadmap” for the future, and vowed to work even harder to bring people together.“Instead of building walls, we can help people build bridges.” he said, echoing a line from recent Hillary Clinton stump speeches in which she contrasts knocking down barriers with Trump’s promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. That, and a February speech in which Pope Francis said, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.” Walls these days: a very controversial thing.Brace yourself for the Trump rant on Twitter that’s sure to come in reply."
The craziest thing about a contested GOP convention? No one will have any idea how to pick a running mate.,90,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News, photo: Larry Downing/Reuters, illustrations: Meriel Jane Waissman/Getty Images, Steve Zmina/Getty Images A version of this story appears on Unconventional, Yahoo Politics’ complete guide to the craziest conventions in decades. The vice presidency has always been the Rodney Dangerfield of American politics: It don’t get no respect.John Nance Garner, FDR’s first vice president, famously likened his job to “a bucket of warm piss.” HBO has devoted an entire primetime comedy to the indignity and inconsequentiality of the office. One recent VP is remembered mainly for misspelling the word “potato.”But now things could get even worse. If this summer’s GOP convention in Cleveland is, in fact, contested — if frontrunner Donald Trump doesn’t clinch the nomination on the first ballot — then it won’t just upend the Republican Party’s presidential selection process. It may also — and this would be unprecedented — transform what is usually a sideshow (the so-called veepstakes) into a circus of its own.“We’re entering uncharted waters,” says Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who specializes in vice presidential history. “We’ve had late VP decisions in the past. But they happened in a different age. The vice presidency was different. Media was different. Technology was different. Expectations were different. We haven’t seen anything like this in the modern era — and my fear is that it might damage the vice presidency itself.”So far, this much is clear: The GOP’s 2016 veepstakes is likely to be weirder than anything we’ve seen before.In a normal presidential-election year — which 2016 is not — the parties tend to coalesce around their nominees long before the conventions. That, in turn, gives each standard-bearer several months to select a running mate. It’s all very polite and predictable. The nominee and his aides conjure up a long list of contenders. They whittle it down to a shortlist, which inevitably leaks. The campaigns vet the candidates; so does the press. Eventually, the nominee settles on a sidekick who satisfies his chosen criteria: electoral strength, ideological balance, personal compatibility, readiness to serve as president, and so forth. The pick is announced, the media salivates, the “rollout” commences. By the time the convention comes around, the drama has pretty much subsided.It wasn’t always thus. Prior to 1804, the vice president was simply the presidential candidate who finished second — even if he didn’t belong to the same party as the new president. For much of the rest of the 19th century, the VP was selected by party bosses (and not the would-be commander in chief). It wasn’t until 1940 that a presidential nominee (Franklin D. Roosevelt) picked his own running mate (Henry Wallace), and it wasn’t until 1976 that a presidential candidate (Ronald Reagan) unveiled his veep choice (Richard Schweiker) before the convention. Today’s rollout process only became standard practice after 1980.The 2016 GOP contest is almost certain to upend that tradition. Is it possible that Trump will win the primaries outright and go on to name his running mate before Cleveland? Technically yes — although, after losing Wisconsin, the tinsel-haired mogul now needs to win 64 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination. (Trump’s current tally: 37 percent.) The likelier outcome is that no candidate arrives at the convention with a majority of delegates (for the first time since 1984) and that no candidate manages to cobble together a majority on the first ballot either (for the first time since 1952). All of which means chaos, maneuvering and multiple rounds of presidential balloting — which in turn almost guarantees that the GOP’s 2016 vice-presidential candidate will be chosen in one of five very odd ways.The first would be the Premature Pick — that is, a VP pick made before the party even chooses its presidential nominee. This is exactly what Reagan did when he selected Schweiker in 1976. The former California governor was neck and neck with incumbent President Gerald Ford at the time, and his hope was that Schweiker, a moderate U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, would soothe fears about his Western conservatism and flip some middle-of-the-road delegates.If Trump, Cruz or Kasich were to name a running mate prior to the convention, they’d be jumping the gun for similarly self-serving reasons: to curry favor with the delegates who will ultimately decide their fate. To reassure party regulars that he isn’t a loose cannon, Trump could tap a steady Washington hand; Kasich or Cruz could team up with, say, Marco Rubio in an attempt to augment their delegate totals and consolidate the GOP’s vast anti-Trump voting bloc. (Cruz allies have already floated this option). The permutations are endless; the key is that the VP slot would become a tool to win the nomination, not the presidency.The second, third and fourth scenarios would all unfold at the convention itself. The Unity Ticket, in which the first- and second-place finishers band together for the good of the party, is the least likely of the three. Unlike John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 or Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush 20 years later, Trump and Cruz are widely seen as general-election liabilities for the GOP; joining forces would only make matters worse. Plus the mudslinging is much more intense in 2016 than it was decades ago. It’s one thing to set aside your qualms about “voodoo economics” for a shot at the vice presidency; it’s another thing to forgive cheap shots about your wife’s appearance for the chance to serve alongside a man you’d  previously said you would run over with your car  .A second- and third-place unity ticket, however, might make more sense; if the convention is deadlocked after several rounds of balloting, and if The Donald is losing ground, Cruz and Kasich could merge their delegates in an effort to vanquish Trump once and for all.Even more likely is the Rushed Running Mate: a new figure who joins the ticket either a) during the balloting process in Cleveland, or b) shortly after the nomination is decided on the floor of the convention hall. Imagine the usual weeks-long rollout procedure, only this time compressed into most hectic and pivotal hours of the entire 2016 GOP contest, when the candidates and their overextended advisers will not have had nearly as much time as earlier campaigns to consider their options and control the unveiling.It is also possible that a majority of delegates could nominate the party’s 2016 veep candidate by themselves — no matter what the presidential candidates do, say, or want.We haven’t seen a Convention’s Choice in a long time — since 1956, to be exact. That year, Adlai Stevenson declined to pick a veep, and the delegates selected Tennessee Sen. Estes Kefauver on his behalf.But while it sounds crazy, this may actually be the least complicated outcome to imagine in 2016: Somewhere along the line, at least 1,237 GOP delegates decide that, regardless of whether Trump or Cruz winds up winning the party’s presidential nod, they would prefer a more palatable choice — a John Kasich, a Paul Ryan, a Marco Rubio, whomever — to balance out the ticket as VP. And then they vote to make it so.The delegates would be perfectly within their rights to do this. The  official RNC rules for picking a vice-presidential nominee  are identical to the rules for picking a presidential nominee: Whoever wins 1,237 delegates at the convention wins the prize. There is no rule that says the delegates have to consider the presidential candidate’s wishes when making their selection.Even RNC chair Reince Priebus has speculated about the Convention’s Choice scenario. On Sunday, Priebus reminded Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that “the delegates choose the vice president as well.”“That’s a subject no one’s really talking about, is that [the VP pick] is another vote on the floor,” Priebus continued. “And so while I’m sure obviously the choice of whoever the nominee is going to be important, it’s still up for a vote of the delegates.”Priebus elaborated the following day in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “Everyone’s unbound,” he said. “There’s no binding. There’s no first- and second- ballot binding. It’s just a free vote.”“They can do whatever they want,” Hewitt added.The final VP scenario — the Delayed Decision — sounds like the sanest option. But in 2016, that may make it the least likely of all. Basically, the RNC rules committee would have to revise its bylaws and defer the final veep vote to a later date so that whoever emerges from Cleveland as the presidential nominee can take the time he needs to consider (and vet) his pick.“In 1972, George McGovern dropped Tom Eagleton from the ticket after it was revealed that Eagleton suffered from depression,” Goldstein explains. “Then McGovern replaced him with Sargent Shriver, and the Democratic Party ratified McGovern’s choice. So a post-convention nomination is at least conceivable — if improbable.”All of these scenarios are politically risky. A Premature Pick could look presumptuous — the equivalent of  Al Gore launching his transition effort before the courts had officially decided the 2000 election. It might also alienate other vice-presidential hopefuls and their fans at the very moment you need all the support you can get, and it would certainly limit your leverage on the convention floor, where the vice presidency may be the only bargaining chip that can push you past the 1,237-delegate mark. In the antagonistic atmosphere of 2016, a unity ticket — especially a Trump-Cruz unity ticket — is unlikely to gel. A Rushed Running Mate could easily backfire (for lack of vetting) or hijack coverage at a time when the focus should be squarely on the candidate. A Convention’s Choice could highlight intraparty division; a Delayed Decision could be messy and confusing.Yet the bigger risk, according to Goldstein, is to the office itself.“If Jimmy Carter had not picked Walter Mondale, I don’t think the vice presidency would have developed in the way it did,” Goldstein says. “Mondale really figured out the modern vision for the office. But he was not Carter’s first choice. Not even close. In fact, it wasn’t until Carter interviewed Mondale a week before the convention, and they really hit it off, that Carter’s doubts were satisfied. Sitting down face-to-face, comparing him to other candidates, going around and talking to party leaders from across the spectrum who said, ‘Mondale’s a great guy’ — that had an impact on Carter. Had he just gotten the nomination and suddenly had to make a choice, the choice would have been different. To pick a good modern vice president, you need to have lots of information. You need to have time. And you need to have a deep pool.”Goldstein worries that all such luxuries will be lost amid the chaos of this year’s GOP presidential contest. Vetting will be “relegated to the backburner” as the campaigns struggle to scrape together 1,237 delegates. The actual decision won’t be made until “late at night, after everyone has been celebrating and carousing, and suddenly someone says, ‘So who should we pick as a running mate?’” And the pool of available veeps may be shallower than ever for several reasons: distaste for Trump, dislike of Cruz, general GOP disunity and the specter of a third-party challenge if the so-called establishment denies Trump the nod.“There are whole lot of scenarios in which the vice presidency could look like not such a great prize,” Goldstein explains. “If Trump is the nominee, a lot of people are going to say ‘I don’t want to defend him every time he insults somebody. I don’t want to be associated with him.’ If Cruz is the nominee, a lot of people — especially his fellow senators — are going to say ‘I can’t stand him. I don’t want to do this.’” If someone like Paul Ryan comes along, Trump may mount an independent bid, or his voters and Cruz’s voters may stay home. The weaker the candidate is — the worse his odds of winning in November — the smaller his pool of potential VPs becomes. Then you’re not looking at the top-echelon people — you’re looking way down the ladder.”In that case, a bucket of warm piss might look good in comparison._____Yahoo News graphics photo credits: Getty Images, CSA images/Getty Images, New York Times Co./Getty Images, Tony Korody/Sygma/Corbis, Ron Edmonds/AP, Getty Images."
Democracy Spring protests at the Capitol,517,"Police arrested more than 400 protesters outside the U.S. Capitol on Monday from Democracy Spring, an organization seeking to remove big money from politics and combat restrictive voter identification laws.The mostly calm and orderly demonstration resulted in arrests for what the U.S. Capitol Police called “unlawful demonstration activity,” such as crowding and obstruction.Organizers vowed to repeat the demonstration every day for a week.The protest was held “to demand Congress take immediate action to end the corruption of big money in our politics and ensure free and fair elections,” Democracy Spring said on its website.The group lists actor Mark Ruffalo and academic Noam Chomsky and dozens of well-known activist groups among its supporters.

"Wall Street bull emerges, makes bold call on stocks",3,"The bull market in stocks is in its seventh year. And if it can stick it out through the end of the month, it will have been the second longest bull market in U.S. history.But there are a lot of reasons to be nervous if you’re long in the stock market. On Friday, Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin warned clients that “near-term risk is skewed to the downside,” largely due to the bad news surrounding earnings season.Then again, when it comes to risk, it’s always something.Sean Darby, Jefferies’ Chief Global Equity Strategist, isn’t fazed by what’s expected to be a particularly awful earnings season.“A combination of improving earnings upgrades, repressed global long-term bond yields and a squeeze on equity supply is likely to mean that U.S. equities will outperform its peer group,” Darby said on Monday. “We upgrade to bullish.”Darby has a 2,180 price target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). The index closed Monday at 2,041.The year started with a lot of uncertainty in the economy. Stock prices wobbled, oil prices tumbled, and measures of economic activity deteriorated all over the world.But the bad news didn’t last too long. In recent weeks, we got economic data that signaled growth was picking up at the end of Q1. This was likely aided by favorable financial conditions.“With real interest rates negative and the dollar’s annualized appreciation abating, U.S. monetary conditions are loosening,” Darby added. “While U.S. economic surprises have surged, independent macro indicators have also rebounded sharply, suggesting investors have underestimated the strength of the economy.”Corporate earnings have been particularly weak in recent quarters. In fact, earnings have been in a full-blown recession. And this is a big deal, since earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.But stocks are also driven by expectations for the future, not the past.“We continue to highlight that the S&P 500 earnings recession was last year,” Darby said. “The U.S. economic surprise has improved sharply, while at the same time the dollar has rolled over. Analysts are beginning to revise up their numbers.”Darby isn’t alone in his assessment that the bad news is largely behind us.“With the big fall in oil and big dollar appreciation behind us and with manufacturing ISM rebounding, there are good reasons to believe that the slowdown in S&P 500 earnings is temporary and we should over the coming quarters see a rebound is overall earnings,” Deutsche Bank’s Torsten Slok said in an email on Sunday. “So yes, earnings have been slowing, but given the turnaround in oil and the dollar, earnings are likely to accelerate again over the coming quarters.”Investors are then faced with two challenges: 1) accept that the past is the past, and 2) decide whether or not the future looks better.“The bottom line is that U.S. equities have a number of favorable tailwinds that should underwrite earnings,” Darby said. “Estimates appear to be backward-looking.”–Sam Ro is managing editor at Yahoo FinanceRead more:Earnings season will be awful — Here are 2 reasons why you shouldn’t panicHere’s brand new proof the US economy is stronger than you thinkMerrill Lynch chief economist nails the truth about risk in a perfect 3-word sentenceFinally, a pulse has returned to global manufacturing"
Are Hillary's big speaking fees being used to help fund her campaign?,2282,"Recently filed campaign finance reports may shed light on how Hillary Clinton is using some of the money she collected from her hefty speechmaking fees from Wall Street banks and other special-interest groups: She is plowing an increasingly large amount of her funds, $560,983 as of last month, back into her presidential campaign.A Yahoo News review of Clinton’s campaign disclosure reports finds that in the weeks after launching her bid for the presidency in April 2015, the former secretary of state paid $278,821 to her campaign to cover so-called testing the waters expenses. These included consulting and legal fees, travel bills and salaries for top staffers like personal aide Huma Abedin and deputy political director Brynne Craig that were incurred during the early months of last year, when Clinton was officially weighing whether to run for president.Since then, the reports show, Clinton has kicked another $282,162 into her campaign, with payments to her campaign committee, Hillary for America, averaging about $90,000 a month. Most of that revenue ($228,837) has gone to the Clinton Executive Services Corp., a Clinton family payroll operation that is compensating staffers engaged in campaign-related work for her chief surrogate, her husband and former president Bill Clinton, according to campaign reports and a Clinton campaign official.The degree to which Clinton is seeking to self-fund her campaign has so far gotten virtually no attention from the media and pales in comparison to the $25 million Donald Trump has loaned his campaign.Still, “the amount of money is striking,” said Lawrence Jacobs, the director of the Center for the Study of Politics at the Hubert Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. “It seems to be an important piece of the puzzle. One question [about Clinton’s speeches] is why she would take the risk of taking so much money from Wall Street and other interest groups. Now we see the full picture. It appears she needed some of the cash to finance her campaign.”A Clinton campaign official, who asked not to be identified, said there was “no connection whatsoever” between Clinton’s speaking fees and her later payments to her campaign committee. And campaign finance lawyers agree that Clinton, like Trump, is legally free to spend as much money as she wants on her campaign.Clinton’s tax returns for 2014 (the last she has publicly released) show that the $10.5 million she earned from speaking fees that year — including talks to Deutsche Bank, GTCR, a Chicago private equity fund, Cisco, Xerox and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, among others — amounted to about two-thirds of her $16 million in gross personal income, with the remaining $5.5 million coming from book royalties. (Her husband reported another $9.7 million in gross income from speaking fees and $36,442 in book income.)While Clinton’s campaign committee has raised a total of $159.9 million so far, the candidate’s own contributions make her by far the biggest source of funds, exceeding the amounts she has raised from partners and employees of major law firms like Paul Weiss ($232,684) and DLA Piper $225,363), as well as the executives and employees of major companies like Google ($224,817) and Morgan Stanley ($222,177), according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.That could prove awkward for a candidate who has portrayed herself as a campaign reformer and touted the importance of small donors in financing her candidacy. And the timing of some of Clinton’s speeches — especially when matched up against the payments to her campaign — raise questions about whether her lucrative speech fees effectively amount to a “pass through” of money from special interest groups to help bankroll her candidacy, according to Jacobs and other ethics advocates.This would appear to be especially the case for the $1.4 million she collected for six speeches in the first three months of 2015. It was a time when the “testing the waters” period of her campaign had already begun and Clinton staffers were being hired in New Hampshire and Iowa. Campaign records show that campaign manager Robby Mook began racking up travel bills (later paid by Clinton herself) as early as Jan. 12, 2015; Abedin and Craig began doing campaign work (also later paid by Clinton) three days later. Her former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, began billing for campaign-related legal work on Feb. 2.During this period, Clinton collected $674,500 for three speeches in Canada on Jan. 20 and 21, 2015 (one of them paid for and two of them co-sponsored by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.) On March 11, 2015, she received $315,000 for a speech to eBay employees in San Jose. That was followed by a $260,000 payment from the New York chapter of the American Camping Association for a talk in Atlantic City on March 19, her last speech before her April 12, 2015, formal announcement that she was a candidate. (Clinton began writing checks to her campaign the next day, on April 13.)“It certainly seems like what she was doing was raising money for her campaign,” said Anne Weismann, executive director for Campaign for Accountability, a watchdog group that advocates for greater transparency in politics. “Everybody knew she was going to run at that point.”Weismann said that under federal election rules, prospective candidates have wide latitude to conduct private business (and later spend their own money) for “testing the waters” expenses before they formally declare their candidacy. “It’s a squishy area of the law,” she said.But she said the most problematic talk appeared to be the final speech before the camping association. The group is a small nonprofit whose $260,000 payment to Clinton (more than the $225,000 she received for talks to the Bank of America or Morgan Stanley) amounted to more than 10 percent of the group’s $2.1 million budget. That recently prompted the organization to add a special note in its annual tax filing with the charities bureau of the New York attorney general’s office, calling the payment to Clinton (described only as a “high-profile politician”) as a “one-time expense” that is “not expected to occur in the subsequent year.”“It’s hard to see how it fits with the mission of that organization to pay $260,000 for a speaker who is about to run for president,” said Weismann. “It all kind of stinks.”The key figure who arranged the talk was the group’s former president, Jay Jacobs, a prominent summer-camp entrepreneur. He is also the Nassau County Democratic Party chairman, a million-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation and a Clinton campaign bundler who is throwing a major fundraiser tonight at one of the six camps he owns, the North Shore Day Camp, in Glen Cove on Long Island.“I made the ask” [to Clinton], Jacobs confirmed to Yahoo News, when asked how the former secretary of state came to speak to the camping group’s annual Tri-State CAMP conference in Atlantic City. Other top officials in the group approached him about the idea because of his well-known relationship with the Clintons, he said. Hillary Clinton, when recently pressed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper about  why she was paid  by so much money ($675,000 for three speeches) from Goldman Sachs, replied, “that’s what they offered.”But that does not appear to have been the case with the nonprofit camping group, according to Jacobs’ account. When he made the request to Clinton’s agent, the Harry Walker Agency, “that’s the fee they came up with,” Jacobs said.But Jacobs rejected the idea there was anything inappropriate — or political — about Clinton’s talk to the organization. Unlike her speeches to Wall Street, Clinton’s appearance that day — a 30-minute talk followed by a 30-minute Q&A session with Jacobs — was open to the press and received largely positive reviews. She talked about her days attending Girl Scout camp, her angst when she sent Chelsea off to language camp for a week one summer (“It was our worst week — well I’ve had a few bad weeks. But it was up there.”) and how the problems of Washington might be solved if there were “camps for adults.” (“We can have the red cabin, the blue cabin, and have to come together and actually listen to each other.”)“Nobody in the camping association would have had any thought about her campaign,” Jacobs said. “Nobody — including me — had any thought about the money going into her campaign.”"
NYC mayor: Hillary Clinton’s plan for Wall Street reform more progressive than Bernie’s,4621,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says Hillary Clinton’s plan for Wall Street reform is more progressive than those of any candidate in the 2016 presidential race — including the one outlined by her Democratic challenger, Bernie Sanders.“Her plan actually goes after the problems we see today,” de Blasio told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric on Monday. “When she talks about the things we need to do to rein in Wall Street, she’s done her homework.”Sanders, he said, hasn’t.“Bernie has put down some very moving ideas and some powerful concepts,” de Blasio said, but hasn’t put forth a “chapter and verse” on how to carry them out.The mayor, who endorsed Clinton last fall, declined to say whether he would advise the former secretary of state to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs because they are “a nonissue.”“Look at her platform,” de Blasio said. “She did not pull punches in that platform — she could’ve. Instead, she said very boldly, ‘Here’s how we’re going to rein in Wall Street. Here’s how we’re going to tax the wealthy.’”De Blasio said he doesn’t worry about Clinton’s “authenticity” problem — with a recent poll showing just 37 percent of Americans saying they believe she is honest and trustworthy, and a majority (57 percent) believing she is not.“I don’t worry about the currents that run through the public discourse,” de Blasio said. “Two and a half million more people have voted for her than Bernie Sanders. She’s won more states than Bernie Sanders. So clearly a lot of people are hearing her message.”The mayor pointed to Clinton’s record on standing up for women’s rights and health care reform as proof of her “consistency on a set of issues.”“She is someone who pushes social change very vibrantly,” de Blasio said. “Whether that’s always received in the discourse is a different question.”The mayor’s comments come ahead of the pivotal April 19 New York primary, which will award 291 delegates in the Democratic race.De Blasio also insisted he doesn’t worry that the vast majority of young voters support Sanders over Clinton.“I think young people have gone through a very troubling time in our history,” de Blasio said. “And I think they’re skeptical. I think they have every reason to be skeptical … But ultimately I believe the vast amount of them will support Hillary.”"
"Joe Biden: ""I Would Like to See a Woman Elected""",23,"Vice President Joe Biden waded into the contentious back-and-forth between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over Clinton's qualifications to serve as president, telling Mic in an exclusive interview that both candidates are ""totally qualified"" — adding that he'd ""like to see a woman elected.""The remarks came during an interview with Mic correspondent Antonia Hylton centered on Biden's crusade against sexual assault, set to be released on Wednesday. Asked whether Sanders' charge that Clinton's super PAC support and her votes for free trade agreements and the Iraq War rendered her unqualified represented another manifestation of sexism, Biden responded with an emphatic ""no.""Sanders' remarks were ""totally different"" from the often-incendiary rhetoric espoused by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Biden said.Watch Biden's comments here:The way the two-time presidential candidate sees it, the Democrats' war of words is par for the course in national campaigns.""Look, they're both totally qualified to be president. They both get in a fight. Campaigns do this. It's like saying, you know, 'She's dead wrong' or her saying, 'He's dead wrong' on an issue,"" the vice president said.Meanwhile, Biden noted, Sanders did not say Clinton is ""not qualified because she's a woman.""Biden — who contemplated entering the 2016 fray himself, before opting against a bid in October — rejected the notion that Clinton is held to a higher standard because she's a woman.""No, I don't think she's held to a higher standard. This country's ready for a woman. There's no problem. We're going to be able to elect a woman in this country,"" Biden said. Asked whether he wanted to see a woman elected, Biden responded, ""I would like to see a woman elected.""The vice president's staff then attempted to cut off discussion of the 2016 race, but Biden insisted he had ""no problem"" with discussing it — while making clear he would not go down ""that rabbit [hole]"" of offering a formal endorsement.""The president and I are not going endorse because we both, when we ran said, 'Let the party decide.' But gosh almighty, they're both qualified,"" he said. ""Hillary's overwhelmingly qualified to be president.""A complex history: Biden's remarks — simultaneously defending both Clinton and Sanders, delivering views that could conceivably irk either camp — are reflective of the larger role he's played in campaign politics since deciding against a run of his own.Though Biden served alongside the former secretary of state in both the Senate and the Obama administration, he's leveled not-so-thinly-veiled criticism of his erstwhile colleague, including in his White House Rose Garden speech announcing his no-go decision.In the speech, Biden railed against ""the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart,"" declaring, ""I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition. They're not our enemies."" Those pointed remarks came just days after Clinton, in a Democratic debate, identified Republicans as among the enemies she was proudest of making.Biden has also questioned Clinton's credentials as a warrior against income inequality, a signature Sanders issue. In a January interview with CNN, Biden said it was ""relatively new for Hillary to talk about"" the issue, while ""Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it."" Biden later walked those comments back a bit, saying he meant Clinton was a newcomer to the inequality debate because she'd been focused on global affairs as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013."

(Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters)In an appearance on “Fox & Friends” Monday morning, Donald Trump was asked about the fact that two of his five children, Ivanka and Eric Trump, are not registered to vote as Republicans in their home state of New York. Trump acknowledged this means they will not be able to vote for him in New York’s Republican presidential primary on April 19.Records from the New York State Board of Elections show that neither Ivanka Trump nor Eric Trump is enrolled in a political party, a fact that was first reported by Yahoo News on April 4.“They had a long time to register, and they were, you know, unaware of the rules, and they didn’t — they didn’t register in time. So they feel very, very guilty. They feel very guilty,” Donald Trump said. “But it’s fine. I mean, I understand that. I think they have to register a year in advance and they didn’t, so Eric and Ivanka, I guess, won’t be voting.” (Yahoo News found that, in addition to the fact they are not Republicans, both Ivanka and Eric Trump have donated money to Democratic candidates and committees.)New York election law does not allow voters to change their party affiliation and vote as a member of a new party in the same year. Ivanka and Eric Trump would have needed to enroll as Republicans by October 14, 2015, to participate in the upcoming primary.Trump’s campaign, which is staffed by relative political newcomers, has had some difficulties with rules and processes. At the Colorado State Republican Convention on Saturday, Trump’s top rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took all 17 delegates after Trump ran what NBC News described as “a disorganized and frustrated campaign plagued by mistakes.” Several other states held delegate selection events over the weekend, and Cruz similarly dominated the process.Donald Trump with, from left, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump at a groundbreaking ceremony for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., in 2014. (Photo: AP)Ivanka and Eric Trump have campaigned extensively for their father along with his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who is a registered Republican in New York. Trump has two other children, 10-year-old Barron, who is too young to vote, and 22-year-old Tiffany, who has not been as active on the campaign trail. Yahoo News could not find voting records for Tiffany. Ivanka and Eric did not respond to requests for comment about their registration status.When he discussed Ivanka and Eric’s inability to back him in the New York primary on “Fox & Friends,” Trump was asked if he would be “cutting off their allowance.”“Yes,” he quipped. “No more allowance.”"
AP-GfK Poll: Clinton has edge over Trump on range of issues,333,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a stark warning for Donald Trump as he eyes a possible general election showdown with Hillary Clinton, Americans trust the Democratic front-runner more than the Republican businessman to handle a wide range of issues — from immigration to health care to nominating Supreme Court justices.Even when asked which of the two candidates would be best at “making American great” — the central promise of Trump’s campaign — Americans are slightly more likely to side with Clinton, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.The survey does reveal some potential trouble spots for Clinton. Trump is nearly even with her on whom Americans trust to handle the economy, which voters consistently rank as one of the top issues facing the country. Clinton is trusted more on the economy by 38 percent of Americans, while 35 percent side with Trump.And despite Americans’ overall preference for Clinton on a host of issues, just 20 percent say she represents their own views very well on matters they care about, while 23 percent say somewhat well.But as with most issues addressed in the AP-GfK poll, the numbers for Trump are even worse: Just 15 percent of Americans say he represents their views very well and 14 percent say somewhat well.Trump’s support with registered Republican voters is also soft on some issues, with less than 50 percent saying they trust him over Clinton on working with Congress or handling the U.S. image abroad. About a quarter of Republicans say they trust neither candidate on either of those issues.Those figures underscore the work the real estate mogul must do to shore up support within his own party if he’s the nominee.Greg Freeman, an independent who leans Republican, said he would “absolutely not” trust Trump to handle major issues facing the United States.“I think he would have the U.S. in wars at the drop of a hat. He would make the international community angry at the United States,” said Freeman, a 41-year-old from Walhalla, South Carolina. “He has a lot of comments on issues, but he has no solutions.”While Clinton and Trump are the favorites to face off in the fall campaign, obstacles remain, particularly for the Republican billionaire. He’s leading in the delegate count, but needs to perform better in the upcoming final primaries in order to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. If he fails to hit that number, the GOP contest will be decided at the party’s convention in July — and it’s unclear whether Trump’s slim campaign operation is prepared for that complex challenge.Clinton has yet to shake Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator who has energized young voters with his calls for breaking up Wall Street banks and making tuition free at public colleges and universities.While Sanders faces tough odds of overtaking Clinton, who has a commanding lead in delegates, his continued presence in the race has rankled the former secretary of state and prevented her from fully turning her attention toward the general election.Still, Clinton has been starting to draw a contrast with her potential Republican opponents, namely Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his closest rival.“I’m really looking forward to debating either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz,” Clinton said Friday. “Mr. Trump, tell me again about how you’re going to build this wall and make the Mexicans pay for it. Tell me again why you think it’s a good idea for Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons.”Trump’s campaign appears well-aware of the need to bolster the businessman’s policy credentials. He’s recently expanded on his foreign policy views, including questioning U.S. participation in the NATO military alliance and suggesting some Asian nations may need nuclear weapons. Campaign officials have also said Trump plans to give a series of policy speeches in the coming weeks.Clinton’s edge over Trump on the issues spans foreign and domestic policy.She holds a significant advantage on handling immigration, health care, the U.S. image abroad, filling Supreme Court vacancies, international trade and working with Congress. Her biggest advantage is on handling gender equality issues, with 55 percent of Americans trusting her and just 12 percent backing Trump.Clinton has a slimmer lead over Trump on which candidate is trusted to protect the country, with 37 percent backing the Democrat and 31 percent backing the Republican. The margin is similar when Americans were asked who they trusted to handle the threat posed by the Islamic State group.Much of Trump’s appeal with voters has rested on his broad pledge to “make America great again.” But when asked which candidate they trusted more to make the country great, 33 percent of Americans picked Clinton and 28 percent backed Trump.Thirty percent said they didn’t trust either candidate to make that happen.___The AP-GfK Poll of 1,076 adults was conducted online March 31-April 4, using a sample drawn from GfK’s probability-based KnowledgePanel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Sanders campaign tries to have it both ways on superdelegates,3413,"Bernie Sanders at a campaign stop at Tindley Temple United Methodist Church in Philadelphia on April 6. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)For months, Democratic National Committee member Billi Gosh has received letters, emails and phone calls urging her to switch her vote at the Democratic National Convention from Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders.Gosh is one of 10 Democratic superdelegates from Vermont, Sanders’ home state, where 86 percent of voters chose him in the Democratic primary in March. Superdelegates — party and elected officials who make up about 15 percent of all Democratic delegates — can vote for whichever candidate they want, unlike pledged delegates, who are divvied up based on how each state’s Democrats voted.“There’s been a lot of pressure on the four us,” Gosh said, referring to herself and the three other pro-Hillary superdelegates in her state, including former Gov. Howard Dean and the current Gov. Pete Shumlin. (Sanders is himself a superdelegate, and it seems fairly certain where his allegiances lie.)Sanders supporters tell Gosh that fairness requires her to back Sanders, who was the overwhelming choice of Vermont voters. They are expanding upon an argument made by Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver in February, who insisted that superdelegates should not go against the “will of the people” and should back whichever candidate gets the most pledged delegates.“If the people in the states choose Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton, I cannot imagine that the superdelegates would overturn the will of the people in this case,” Weaver told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC.The progressive, Sanders-backing group MoveOn.org as well as the super-PAC Progressive Kick urged idealistic Sanders supporters to take this populist fight to superdelegates. “We will not allow Democratic Party insiders to determine the outcome of this election. Democratic voters will decide the party’s nominee,” said MoveOn’s executive director in a petition against superdelegates. The supporters argue that superdelegates are not reflecting the votes of the people in their states, which they say is undemocratic and elitist. “People think there is some sort of secret cabal going on trying to stop Bernie Sanders from getting the nomination,” said Kathy Sullivan, a New Hampshire superdelegate who received dozens of occasionally angry calls and emails.But recently, beginning after Sanders’ landslide victories in Alaska and Washington at the end of last month, the Sanders campaign has begun singing a different tune. Even as Bernie’s supporters continue to inundate superdelegates with their anti-elitist arguments, Sanders and his top campaign officials are now arguing that superdelegates should back Bernie even in states where he didn’t win — and even if he doesn’t win a majority of the popular votes cast. The campaign also has tried to poach some Clinton-backing superdelegates.Late last month, Sanders said on CNN that he hopes superdelegates “rethink their position with Hillary Clinton” because some polls show Sanders does better in a hypothetical matchup against Donald Trump than she does. His argument seems to be that superdelegates should back the most “electable” candidate, no matter how many votes he or she got in the state.Bernie Sanders greets supporters at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on April 6. (Photo: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters)But in an apparent case of trying to have his cake and eat it too, in the same interview Sanders said he was entitled to the backing of superdelegates in the states he won — the populist argument of his supporters. “And then you have got superdelegates who are in states where we win by 40 or 50 points,” he added. “I think their own constituents are going to say to them, ‘Hey, why don’t you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?’”What’s behind this tactical shift? One possibility is that the Sanders camp realized they would need the votes of at least some superdelegates even in the states he didn’t carry. As the Washington Post points out, caucus states, where Sanders has done the best, tend to have fewer superdelegates to award, so Clinton would still lead Sanders by several hundred superdelegates, even if you gave Sanders all of them in the states he won.Also, the Sanders campaign has emphasized the “momentum” it’s shown — Sanders has won the past seven states in a row — as a counterweight to the fact that he is still trailing Clinton in pledged delegates and in the popular vote.Sanders strategist Tad Devine told the Washington Post that even if Sanders is behind in the popular vote and the number of pledged delegates, “We’re going to make an argument that you should nominate Bernie Sanders.”Devine did not respond to a request for comment from Yahoo News.And last week, Weaver said on an ABC News podcast that even if Clinton has won more pledged delegates and captured a larger share of the popular vote, the campaign “absolutely” plans to contest her nomination at the convention in Philadelphia.Stuart Appelbaum, a superdelegate in New York who backs Clinton, said he believes the focus on superdelegates is a distraction from the tough math Sanders faces in the final months of the primary. He would have to gain at least 60 percent of the vote in New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania to overtake Clinton’s pledged delegate lead.“I really look at the discussion of superdelegates now as just really being an attempt to provide a rationale for why a candidate should stay in the race when it appears that it’s going to be mathematically impossible for them to become the nominee,” he said. “I don’t know a single superdelegate who has said they’re going to switch. I don’t expect that anyone will.”"
Bernie Sanders: ‘I appreciate Bill Clinton being my psychoanalyst. It’s always nice.’,3461,"Bernie Sanders says it’s clear that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has turned negative now that he’s won seven of the last eight contests in the race for the Democratic nomination. And former President Bill Clinton’s assertion that Sanders is only questioning her qualifications because she is a woman, he says, is proof of that negative tone.“Of course you wouldn’t have made the same charges if she were a man,” Bill Clinton said of Sanders. “I think there are some different standards for women — some of them are subconscious.”“I appreciate Bill Clinton being my psychoanalyst. It’s always nice,” Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union” in an interview that aired Sunday. “But the reality is that ever since Wisconsin, when that became the sixth out of seven states that we have won in either caucuses or primaries, I think the Clinton campaign has made it public, basically, they told the media, that here in New York they’re about to become very negative, about to beat us up.”The self-described democratic socialist said he’s not about to take it lying down.“I just want them to understand that we have tried to run an issue-oriented campaign but that we are not going to be attacked every single day,” Sanders said. “Our record is not going to be distorted. We are going to fight back.”Sanders, though, would not take the bait when asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper to comment on Bill Clinton’s controversial response to a Black Lives Matter protester at a rally in Philadelphia last week.“Sorry, Jake,” Sanders said. “Not going to go there.”The protest stemmed over Hillary Clinton’s use of the term “super predators” to describe some African-American criminals in the 1990s.“I think the secretary has said that she would not use that term again,” Sanders said. “I think it has race connotations at that period. And I think Secretary Clinton said that is not a phrase she would use again.”But Sanders did slap the Democratic frontrunner over her suggestion that she feels “sorry” for his young supporters who she said “don’t do their own research” on the race.“I think that’s a little bit condescending,” Sanders said. “These are young people who want to be involved in shaping the future of this country. They’re proud of this country. They want to make it a better country. I think they do a whole lot of research and I think that the Internet has opened up the opportunity for them to do a lot of research. And I’ll tell you, one of the reasons I think we’re doing so well is a lot of those people are going to the Internet and hearing what we have to say.”Sanders did not question Clinton’s qualifications, only saying he has “doubts about what kind of president she would make.” But the Vermont senator indicated he would support her if she becomes the Democratic nominee.“I think she and I would agree — and I hope that is her view — that we would do everything possible to prevent this country from seeing Donald Trump or some other Republican in the White House,” he said. “That would be a disaster for this country. And I will do everything I can to prevent that.”"
Obama says Hillary Clinton’s emails never jeopardized America’s national security,7961,"President Obama says Hillary Clinton showed a degree of “carelessness” in using a private email server as secretary of state, but never jeopardized national security.“I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America’s national security,” Obama told “Fox News Sunday” in a wide-ranging interview. “What I’ve also said is that — and she has acknowledged — that there’s a carelessness, in terms of managing e-mails, that she has owned, and she recognizes.”The president said that there are varying degrees of classified material being handled in the upper reaches of government.“What I also know, because I handle a lot of classified information, is that there are — there’s classified, and then there’s classified,” Obama said. “There’s stuff that is really top-secret, top-secret, and there’s stuff that is being presented to the president or the secretary of state that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get in open-source.”“But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective,” he continued. “This is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state and did an outstanding job.”Obama was also asked if he could guarantee the White House will not interfere with the ongoing FBI probe into Clinton’s handling of her emails.“I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department or FBI — not just in this case, but in any case,” the president said. “Period. Full stop. Nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department. Because nobody is above the law.”“I do not talk to the attorney general about pending investigations,” he said. “I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. We have a strict line and always have maintained it.”During the interview — his first with “Fox News Sunday” since becoming president — Obama discussed the GOP response to Judge Merrick Garland, his Supreme Court nominee.“Originally, the Republicans said they wouldn’t meet with him at all,” Obama said. “Now a number of them have already had meetings. And the questioning that they’re having privately with Judge Garland is something that should be done publicly, through a hearings process, so the American people can make their own assessment. But I recognize there’s pressure on the other side. Our goal is just to make sure that the Senate does its job and treats him fairly.”The president also defended his response to the recent terror attack in Brussels, dismissing critics who said he should’ve curtailed his diplomatic trip to Cuba and Argentina and returned to the United States.“In the wake of terrorist attacks, it has been my view consistently — that the job of the terrorists, in their minds, is to induce panic, induce fear, get societies to change who they are,” Obama said. “And what I’ve tried to communicate is, ‘You can’t change us. You can kill some of us, but we will hunt you down, and we will get you.’ And in the meantime, just as we did in Boston, after the marathon bombing, we’re going to go to a ball game.”Obama was also asked what he considers his “worst mistake” in nearly two terms as president.“Probably failing to plan for, the day after, what I think was the right thing to do, in intervening in Libya,” Obama said, referring to the 2011 U.S.-backed intervention that helped topple Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi but left the country in turmoil.What does the president consider his biggest accomplishment?“Saving the economy from a Great Depression,” he said."
Boston Globe publishes front page imagining a world with President Donald Trump,6466,"Courtesy of the Boston GlobeLast night, the Boston Globe had a fever dream starring President Donald J. Trump.The newspaper published a satirical front page on Sunday imagining what the world would be like a year from now if Trump becomes commander in chief.“DEPORTATIONS TO BEGIN,” blares the headline on April 9, 2017, above a photo of the would-be 45th U.S. president and an accompanying story detailing how Trump would carry out one of his campaign promises: the deportation of 11.3 million illegal workers — something he vowed to do “so fast your head will spin.”Other headlines covered some troubling developments during Trump’s first 100 days in the White House, from the war on terror (“U.S. soldiers refuse orders to kill ISIS families”) to trade (“Markets sink as trade war looms”) to journalism (“New libel law targets ‘absolute scum’ in press”) to space exploration (“NASA engineers halted the launch of an unmanned probe amid fears that its new gold leaf trim would interfere with radio communications”) to the U.S. park system (“Heavy spring snow closed Trump National Park for the first time since it dropped its loser name, Yellowstone”).Perhaps more troubling: Kid Rock is a U.S. ambassador in a Trump administration. And the education secretary? Former “Celebrity Apprentice” star Omarosa.“This is Donald Trump’s America,” the Globe said in an editor’s note. “What you read on this page is what might happen if the GOP frontrunner can put his ideas into practice, his words into action. Many Americans might find this vision appealing, but the Globe’s editorial board finds it deeply troubling.”The board elaborated on what it described as “the dangers of Trump’s vision” in a separate op-ed:At a rally in Rochester, N.Y., on Sunday afternoon, Trump fired back.“How about that stupid Boston Globe — it’s worthless,” he said. “They made up an entire front-page story — which is really no different than the whole paper.”"
Florida gov. reacts to Starbucks critic with attack ad,2004,"One might think a governor with a mere 38 percent approval rating would be able to handle a little criticism from his constituents. But as Florida resident Cara Jennings learned this week, apparently no one attacks Rick Scott and gets away with it. Two days after Jennings was seen calling the Florida Republican governor “an a**hole” and an “embarrassment to our state” at a Starbucks in Gainesville, Scott’s political action committee has fired back with a video of its own. The newly released ad, titled “Latte Liberal Gets an Earful,” sets out to not only defend the governor’s record but also attack Jennings’ character, declaring that the “terribly rude woman” who lambasted Scott’s record on health care, abortion and employment “clearly has a problem.”Based on PolitiFact’s fact checking of the now widely seen confrontation, Scott could have easily poked a few holes in most of Jennings’ claims. For example, the governor did not technically “cut Medicaid” as Jennings stated, but rather refused to expand the health care program to cover more low-income Floridians under a provision of the Affordable Care Act.And while Scott did indeed recently sign a law that eliminates state funding for all health clinics that offer abortions — including Planned Parenthood, which provides a wide range of women’s health care services beyond abortion — he could have disputed Jennings’ claim that he “stripped women of access to public health care,” because technically not all public health clinics are ineligible for state funding under the law, just those that provide abortions. Rather than address her specific allegations, however, the folks over at Scott’s Let’s Get to Work PAC chose to dig up some dirt on Jennings.“It turns out,” the ad reveals, “she’s a former government official who refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and calls herself an anarchist.”Only after attempting to discredit her does the ad actually refute something that Jennings said. During the epic coffee shop confrontation, the governor responded to the charge that he doesn’t “care about working people” by noting that 1 million jobs have been created in Florida since he took office.“A million jobs?” Jennings asked in disbelief. “Who here has a great job?”While PolitiFact argues that Scott can’t take complete credit for his state’s job growth, the ad doubles down on that defense, pointing out that 9,300 new jobs have been created just in the area surrounding the scene of the Starbucks showdown.“Who here has a great job?” The ad asks, mimicking Jennings’ question. “Well, almost everybody. Except those sitting around coffee shops demanding public assistance, surfing the Internet and cursing at customers who come in.”In an interview with the Sun-Sentinel, Jennings said she does not receive public assistance and that she was working on a fre  e lance gig at Starbucks when the interaction with Scott, which she says started out as civil, took place. Jennings told the paper that she sent a letter to Scott’s office asking the governor to meet for coffee to discuss her concerns, but she took the ad to mean her invitation had been declined. “Gov. Scott and his PAC are bullies,” Jennings said. “Instead of addressing the issues I brought up, he’s using the power of his PAC to try to intimidate someone who spoke out against his policies.”"
Bill Clinton trades barbs with Black Lives Matter protesters in Philadelphia,5161,"Former President Bill Clinton traded barbs with Black Lives Matter protesters who repeatedly interrupted him during a campaign event for his wife, Hillary Clinton, in Philadelphia Thursday.“I like protesters, but the ones who won’t let you answer are afraid of the truth,” Clinton said, before attempting to defend some of the more controversial policies of his own presidency, such as the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, that have prompted activist criticism against Hillary Clinton’s White House bid.Despite having since denounced the legislation — which, more than 20 years after its passage, is widely considered responsible for the problem of mass incarceration in the U.S. — Hillary Clinton’s previous support for the bill has continued to haunt her presidential campaign, as has the comment she made referring to juvenile offenders as “super predators” during her husband’s 1996 primary campaign for reelection. After an activist confronted Hillary Clinton about the 20-year-old remark at a fundraiser ahead of South Carolina’s democratic primary, the candidate apologized, saying that she “shouldn’t have used those words,” and insisting that she “wouldn’t use them today.” Her husband, however, took a different approach when faced with the same criticism in Philadelphia on Thursday.“I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children,” Bill Clinton told protesters, defending his wife’s controversial “super predators” comment. “Maybe you thought they were good citizens; she didn’t.”“You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter,” he added.Bill Clinton has also repudiated the 1994 crime bill, lamenting the results of some of the harsher provisions — without which, he has argued, the otherwise good legislation would never have passed.President Bill Clinton signs the $30 billion crime bill at the White House on Sept. 13, 1994. (Photo: Denis Paquin/AP)Clinton doubled down on this stance during his speech in Philadelphia Thursday, insisting through interruptions that he had “talked to a lot of African-American groups; they thought black lives mattered,” and even with the addition of harsher sentencing provisions, “they said take this bill because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs.”Pointing to a protester in the crowd, Clinton charged, “She don’t want to hear any of that. You know what else she don’t want to hear? Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and — listen to this — because of that and the background-check law, we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence.” Apparently unfazed by the disruptive crowd, Clinton actually managed to use the protesters’ slogan to continue making a case for Hillary. “I’ll tell you another story about a place where black lives matter: Africa,” Clinton said, transitioning back into his regular stump speech with a story about the former secretary of state’s work in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania."
The subway primary: Candidates (try to) take Manhattan ... and Brooklyn and the Bronx too,843,"With the 2016 campaign now focused squarely on the April 19 primary in New York, the five remaining presidential candidates have taken to the Big Apple looking to connect with everyday New Yorkers. And it’s not as easy as it looks.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>Bernie Sanders was mocked after an interview with the Daily News last week in which the 74-year-old Brooklyn-born Vermont senator revealed he didn’t know the New York City subway system no longer uses tokens.“What do you mean, ‘How do you ride the subway these days?’ You get a token and you get on,” Sanders said when asked about his straphanger experience.Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, speaking to reporters in the Bronx early Thursday, took a swipe at Sanders before hopping on the subway at the 161st St.-Yankee Stadium station.Hillary Clinton holds her MetroCard as she tries to use the turnstile to enter a subway station in the Bronx on Thursday. (Photo: Richard Drew/AP)“I think it was my first term when we changed from tokens to MetroCards,” the former New York senator said.But Clinton appeared to have some trouble swiping through the turnstile. Reporters tailing the former secretary of state noted it took her at least five swipes before she was able to access the No. 4 train platform — apparently a common problem, judging by the outpouring of complaints about subway turnstiles on Twitter after her jaunt.The local transportation fumbles of Sanders and Clinton paled in comparison to the hostile greeting that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz received during a visit a Dominican eatery in the South Bronx.“Why are you in the Bronx if you’re such an anti-immigrant?” Gonzalo Venegas asked him shortly after the Republican hopeful arrived.“We’re one of the poorest congressional districts in the country, and to receive this right-wing bigot is an insult to the whole community!” Venegas’ brother Rodrigo shouted. “People are dying! People are dying, Ted Cruz!”Cover of Thursday’s New York Daily News.

(Photo: Carlo Allegri/Reuters)According to reporters, the GOP hopeful consumed no less than two plates of spaghetti, half an Italian sub and even some wine.“This is like being so alive, being in New York,” a stuffed Kasich told reporters.At a rally on Long Island Wednesday night, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said, “It’s great to be home,” before tearing into Cruz’s criticism of his “New York values.”“Like we’re no good,” Trump said. “I started talking to him about the World Trade Center — the bravery, the incredible bravery — and I’ve got this guy standing over there looking at me, talking about New York values with scorn in his face, with hatred, hatred of New York.”Earlier in his speech, the billionaire reality-TV star reflected on his days of playing golf at nearby Bethpage State Park."
Megyn Kelly: Trump tried to ‘curry favor’ with me at start of campaign,1199,"Up until about a year ago, Donald Trump was but a minor figure in Megyn Kelly’s life. He’d made a couple of appearances on her Fox News show, “The Kelly File,” but beyond that, Kelly’s interactions with the real estate mogul had been minimal at best.Then, shortly before he launched his historically unconventional presidential campaign in June 2015, Trump started reaching out to Kelly directly. He’d call to compliment segments of her show that he’d enjoyed or send autographed clips of newspaper articles that mentioned her.In retrospect, Kelly told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric at Tina Brown’s seventh annual Women in the World summit Wednesday, the candidate was likely “trying to curry favor” with the Fox News anchor. She also told Couric that she later found out Trump had made similar overtures to other journalists. But at the time, Kelly said, she didn’t think much of it.It was only after she hit the brazen billionaire with a hardball question during the first Republican presidential debate of 2016 — prompting Trump to boycott the following Fox News debate and launch a stream of attacks against Kelly that Fox News recently deemed “extreme,” “sick” and “beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land” — that Kelly said she recognized Trump’s newfound friendliness for what it was.“I think he felt betrayed,” Kelly said of Trump’s reaction to her question, which prodded him on his record of making disparaging and degrading comments about women. His immediate response, she noted, was, “I’ve been very nice to you.”“But I didn’t ask him to call me or send me those clippings,” Kelly told Couric. “It was a nice gesture, but it’s not going to stop me from asking tough questions.”Fox News Channel anchors and debate moderators, from left, Chris Wallace, Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier, begin the Jan. 28 Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters)Couric and Kelly later discussed whether the appeal of high ratings influenced the way the press covered Trump as compared to other candidates.“If everyone had stood up from the beginning and asked very tough questions — which is what we get paid to do — there wouldn’t have been this issue, because we would have all been shoulder to shoulder asking tough questions so you couldn’t cut off access,” Kelly said.“You can’t, as a presidential candidate, shut down everybody. You can’t shut down Fox, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, you can’t,” Kelly said. “There is strength in numbers on our side too, and this was a moment, an opportunity for solidarity among the press that I think we missed.”It was no doubt Kelly’s willingness to take on perhaps the country’s biggest bully that earned her a spot among the headliners at Brown’s annual gathering of female journalists, activists, world leaders and celebrities at Lincoln Center.Still, Kelly admitted Wednesday, being in Trump’s crosshairs isn’t always easy.“I’m not going to say it doesn’t bother me,” Kelly replied when Couric asked how she deals with the “onslaught of nastiness” from Trump. “It has bothered me and at times it has gotten very ugly. But I also understand that it’s part of the job.”"
"In diverse and liberal New York, Ted Cruz seeks his sliver of support",981,"BRONX, N.Y.—Fresh from a key victory in Wisconsin’s primary, Ted Cruz arrived at Saburosa 2 — a Dominican eatery owned by Chinese-Americans in the South Bronx — ready to court a small, conservative constituency scattered around the largely blue state of New York. But as the afternoon meet and greet unfolded, it became clear that the Texas senator wouldn’t be able to woo potential supporters without also encountering challengers.“Why are you in the Bronx if you’re such an anti-immigrant?” asked Gonzalo Venegas, who was with his brother, Rodrigo. The two co-host a show on TeleSur English and make up the Bronx hip-hop duo Rebel Diaz.As the brothers were escorted by police out of a crowd filled with men wearing either cowboy hats or yarmulkes, Rodrigo continued to rip into Cruz’s anti-immigration attitude and highlight what he called “environmental racism,” which his community was experiencing because of climate change.“We’re one of the poorest congressional districts in the country, and to receive this right-wing bigot is an insult to the whole community,” he yelled. “People are dying!” he continued, as sweat rolled down his temple. “People are dying, Ted Cruz!”Cruz shakes hands of supporters at Saburosa 2 in the Bronx. (Photo: Timothy A. Clary/AFP).Though the meet and greet continued, the disruption set a tone for the event. Even if Cruz was able to arrange a backroom schmoozing session hosted by Democratic state Sen.Rubén Díaz, his plan to collect at least some of  New York’s 95 GOP delegates would definitely come with image problems.But in the face of protests, and despite polling in third place in the state, Cruz knew exactly what he was doing in a minority-rich district with conservative tendencies. New York is among the 24 states that award delegates by congressional district, rather than on a statewide basis. Generally each district choses three delegates — five in Missouri.If Cruz is able to pick off a few districts where his socially conservative views appeal to voters — like the heavily Latino 15th Congressional District — he’ll receive a considerable bump in his delegate count, regardless of how unpopular he might be to the majority of Manhattanites. It explains his appearance in the Bronx on Wednesday, and his packed Thursday schedule, which includes a town hall in a village northwest of Albany, an appearance at a Bronx deli and a tour of a matzo bakery in Brooklyn’s Brighton Beach.Ted Cruz speaking to the press after the meet and greet. (Alyssa Bereznak/Yahoo News).During a brief press Q&A after the event, Cruz made the connection between his views and those of the Latino community. He praised the immigrant work ethic, argued for the importance of small businesses and education, and bashed New York mayor and “liberal democrat” Bill de Blasio for being controlled by unions and not standing by the NYPD. But when a news anchor for a Spanish-language television station asked him a question, he stumbled, attempting to answer in Spanish but then switching to English.“I have the problem of a second-generation immigrant,” said the Texas senator, who famously sparred with former presidential candidate Marco Rubio during a debate about his Spanish-speaking skills. “I learned Spanish when I was a little kid, but to be honest, what I really spoke at home was Spanglish. As you know in our community, that’s true with just about everyone and certainly with their kids.”He forged on.“In the Hispanic community we have shared values,” he said. “The values that resonate in our community are faith, family, patriotism. I think the most powerful value in this community is the American dream. We’re filled with optimism. When my dad came to America from Cuba, he couldn’t speak English, he was washing dishes, but he was filled with hopes and dreams for the future and for his kids.”SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>Though his stumble may have hurt his appearance of authenticity among potential Latino voters, many attendees at the event said Cruz’s socially conservative views on issues like abortion and religious liberty ultimately made him the more attractive candidate over New York resident Donald Trump.“As a junior senator, he stood up against the establishment on a lot of issues and stood his ground,” Donald Sadler, a 51-year-old pastor from Orange County, N.Y., told Yahoo News. “He’s done things for the veterans, he’s pro-life, he’s pro-family, pro-constitution, pro second amendment — all the issues that are important to me, my family and the future of this country.”Yonatan Telesky, a 30-year-old Orthodox Jewish resident of Manhattan and a registered Democrat, said that of the four viable candidates left in the race, Cruz is the only one whose views align with the interests of the Orthodox Jewish community and the black and Hispanic religious communities in the rest of New York State.“If he makes a good campaign, he has a chance to win quite a few congressional districts,” Telesky told Yahoo News. “There are practically no Republicans here, so if he can get the few Republicans in each one, he might beat Trump.”The scene outside the restaurant. (Photo: Alyssa Bereznak/Yahoo News).As Cruz exited the building, flanked by a scrum of news reporters, a small crowd had formed outside the restaurant and around the shiny black SUV that would be his getaway car. A Muslim man sparred with a Cruz supporter, yelling about the senator’s recent comment that America must secure Muslim neighborhoods. Another man quietly held up a sign that said “Defy the gay mafia” next to a woman with a rainbow-colored sign that read “Love wins.” It was just another day in New York."
The Republican Party can’t steal what Trump didn’t earn,4220,"If Donald Trump doesn’t lock down the nomination before the convention, would the party elite plot to install Ted Cruz or John Kasich instead? (Photo: Getty Images)Finally, it’s here!Every four years, as predictable as Bill O’Reilly hawking his own books under the guise of viewer mail, the leading prognosticators in my industry dream aloud of a contested convention. It usually goes something like: If Hillary Clinton wins the South and Bernie Sanders wins the Midwest, and then California splits off from the mainland and sinks at sea, and then nine superdelegates have heart attacks and die on the same day … we really could be headed for a second ballot, at least!We get that you get how pathetic this is, but understand: Orchestrated conventions are like corporate-sponsored gulags. Old-timey straw hats, floor managers barking out urgent orders, giant placards bashing in the heads of rival delegations — this is our desert mirage, the image that sustains us through all the months of drudgery. It’s the only thing we ask of John King and his Magic Wall of Wishes.And here we are at last. Because after Ted Cruz’s resounding win in Wisconsin Tuesday, it seems that Donald Trump and the leaders of his party — or at least the party he has decided to acquire for purposes of this campaign — are likely headed for a death match in Cleveland in July, from which only one (or neither) can emerge intact.But wait, you say. What if Trump doesn’t win the necessary delegates but comes within a handful of locking down the nomination, as he very well might? Would the party elite really huddle in some smoke-filled luxury suite, with enraged Trump supporters screaming below them, and plot to install Ted Cruz or John Kasich, or maybe even Paul Ryan, instead?The answer is no and yes. No because you really can’t smoke in a luxury suite these days, which is just another reason America never wins anymore. And yes because that’s exactly what Republican leaders will try to do, and if you understand the reason political parties were put on earth, then you shouldn’t be surprised.Or as Kasich put it when we talked about the possibility of a contested convention a few weeks ago: “Why are people hyperventilating about that?”Some quick history might be useful here. Up until about 40 years ago, voters in both parties had only a limited say in choosing their nominees. That is, a bunch of states held binding primaries and caucuses, but most did not; the main value of the voting process was that it gave powerful convention delegates a good sense of which candidate could get himself elected.Neither Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 nor Richard Nixon in 1968, the last two Republican presidents nominated under this system, showed up to their respective conventions with the requisite number of delegates in hand. Eisenhower’s nomination was particularly bruising (it involved a fight over the seating of two Southern state delegations that opposed him), and he needed a couple of tries on the convention floor to get it done.Beginning with the Democrats after 1968, and followed quickly by the Republicans, both parties then shifted to what we know as the modern nomination process, where virtually every state allows its voters to select a slate of delegates. Every triumphant Republican candidate since 1980 has locked down the nomination before the convention. It’s still possible Trump could get there, too, or at least very close.But nomination contests aren’t plebiscites, and conventions aren’t horseshoes. Close doesn’t actually entitle you to anything.The decision still rests with the delegates, as it always has, and if Trump can’t convince a relative handful of uncommitted delegates to get him over the top, then there’s something deeply flawed about his candidacy. (Well, yeah.) That’s not a case of being cheated out of what’s yours; that’s just failing to secure what you didn’t really have to begin with.Or to put this another way: Telling the party it has to nominate you because you have almost the delegate count you need is like telling the lottery commission that you deserve the Powerball payout because you’re only one number off.But hold on, you might say. What about the will of the electorate? If Trump has a clear plurality of voters, wouldn’t it be stealing to swing the nomination to someone else? Wouldn’t Americans lose all faith in the process?All of which gets to the heart of what’s dysfunctional about our political system right now.Fifty years ago, you could have made a pretty compelling case that the clear choice of a primary electorate, even if that candidate didn’t clear the delegate threshold, reflected the will of some broad swath of Americans. When Eisenhower was elected, we were a nation of party members. About three-quarters of the country self-identified as either Democrats or Republicans, according to data from the Pew Research Center.For decades now, however, as Americans have become ever more estranged from clubs and civic organizations and ever more suspect of politics, we independents have accounted for the fastest-growing bloc of voters. According to the most recent data, almost 4 in 10 voters decline to affiliate with a party, and self-identified Republicans make up only 23 percent of the electorate.(That’s roughly the same percentage as in the dark days just after Watergate, when joining the Republican Party was like signing up to get Legionnaires’ disease.)Of those voters who still identify themselves in partisan terms, an ever smaller number actually participate as activists or even as perennial primary voters. Which means that, increasingly, any primary process can be effectively overwhelmed by a highly motivated subset of voters who bear little resemblance to the electorate as a whole.The job of a political party, though, isn’t simply to validate the vote, to lend itself out as a vehicle for whatever uprising has suddenly taken hold in its ranks. Parties exist to advance agendas, to enact policies, to attain and hold power. They exist, in other words, to win.Trump doesn’t really adhere to any governing agenda, and a mountain of polls suggest that he repulses a strikingly high percentage of voters.If Trump arrives in Cleveland with 1,237 delegates, then he’s earned the nomination, without having resorted to subterfuge or even having tapped his own fortune, and Republicans are stuck with him anyway. But if that number tops out at 1,236, then you can bet the party’s leaders will explore their options.Maybe that means swinging their support to Cruz, who’s more viable than Trump only in the same sense that American is a more viable option than United; either way, you’re going to pay a steep price for the baggage. Or maybe the delegates declare a reset and try to impose a nominee like Kasich or Ryan — just to see if Mitt Romney’s head will explode.Whatever the plan, it would be hard to blame Republican leaders, assuming they still exist somewhere, for trying. It’s not just their right to avail themselves of the rules if they think they can save the party from a looming disaster. It’s their responsibility, too."
7 ways Donald Trump is just like the Founding Fathers,10791,"Photo illustration: Yahoo News. Photos: Corbis (2), AP, Getty Images (2).About half a dozen times in the past few weeks I have been taken aside by a 20-something who’s looking for reassurance that the republic will not end. There has never been any campaign like this in the history of the nation, they say, and they know this is true because they’ve read it everywhere.“We have officially hit a new low in political discourse,” declared Stephen Colbert (after Trump’s penis allusion on national television). Next, the Huffington Post warned, “Recent violence at Trump rallies marks a new low for American politics.” Not long after that, the Financial Times said: “Trump v Cruz hits new low as wives dragged into fray.”A new low. A new low? Heavens no, I say, in my best wizened voice. Not even close. Rather than ending the republic, these folks would fit right in with the men who founded it. What’s distressing is not that this adolescent baiting and sniping is unheard of, but that it isn’t. We should have outgrown this by now.To wit:Name calling: Donald Trump, in particular, is so fond of calling people names that a running list of epithets being kept by the New York Times now includes more than 200 of his targets. Not a one of his zingers comes close to what leaders and would-be leaders spat at each other throughout history though, and not just because Trump uses far fewer syllables.Jefferson’s supporters, for instance, described Adams as suffering from a “hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Adams’ supporters in turn called Jefferson “a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father.” Theodore Roosevelt called Woodrow Wilson “that Byzantine logothete, supported by all the flubdubs, mollycoddles, and flapdoodle pacifists.” (Translation: A logothete is a paper pusher; a flubdub is one who speaks nonsense; to mollycoddle means to treat with kid gloves.)And then there was Thomas Paine, who wrote “The Rights of Man,” and whose critics, according to Harvard historian Jill Lepore, described him as follows: Horribly ugly, smelly, rude and relentlessly cruel…caus(ing) his first wife’s death by beating her while she was pregnant and abus(ing) his second wife almost as badly, except that she wasn’t really his wife because he never consummated that marriage, preferring, instead, to have sex with cats. In other words, no one has (yet) accused anyone of bestiality this campaign season, so we’re still ahead. Speaking of sex, and the sexes: Our earliest leaders may have descended from Puritans, but there was nothing puritanical about them. A certain current hit musical incorporates Alexander Hamilton’s affair as a plot device, as it led to the young country’s first sex scandal. What the Broadway version doesn’t include is John Adams’ opinion that Hamilton’s actions were caused by “a superabundance of secretions, which he couldn’t find enough whores to absorb.”Jefferson, in turn, was accused of having sex with his slaves, an accusation that would not be proven for centuries, but that didn’t stop his contemporaries from making it. Benjamin Franklin, who wrote a sex advice column in the 1700s (which included ruminations on why younger men should have affairs with older women because “regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one”), was described by Adams thusly: “His whole life has been one continued insult to good manners and to decency.”“It got scatological and salacious,” says Joseph J. Ellis, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Founding Brothers.” “History is full of bad behavior.”John Quincy Adams was called a pimp, which he probably wasn’t. Andrew Jackson was called a bigamist, which he wasn’t, but his wife was, because she married him without realizing that her divorce was not yet final. Not enough to smear Jackson’s wife, opponents went to work on his parents: “General Jackson’s mother was a common prostitute, brought to this country by the British soldiers! She afterward married a mulatto man, with whom she had several children, of which number General Jackson is one!” wrote one newspaper at the time.So, no, Senator Cruz, wives and families have not historically been off-limits. Julia Grant was called cross-eyed. Mary Todd Lincoln spent too much money on dresses and put too much faith in séances. Nellie Taft smoked, and Rachel Jackson was plump. When Warren G. Harding died in office, political gossipers said his wife, Florence, poisoned him. No, there are no instances of nude photos of would-be first ladies used in attack ads, but that’s likely only because no other would-be first lady has posed in the nude professionally.They called each other cowards: Cruz did so directly. (“Donald, you’re a sniveling coward, leave Heidi the hell alone.”) Trump did so indirectly, saying he is the only one strong enough to stand up to Putin, Mexico, ISIS and hecklers at campaign rallies. Back in the day, politicians used the term when they were talking about things like actual war.When former Mexican War Gen. Winfield Scott tried to unseat President Franklin Pierce, also a Mexican War general, Scott’s supporters dubbed Pierce “the fainting general.” Pierce had, in fact, once fainted on the battlefield and had to be carried off. What his opponents didn’t mention was that it wasn’t fear that made him faint. It was the pain from a wrenched knee caused by a lurching horse.There were also a lot of snipes about the sturdiness of the other guy’s spine. Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president, remarked that  James Garfield, the 20th president, “is not possessed of the backbone of an angleworm.”Theodore Roosevelt, then assistant secretary of the Navy, said about  William McKinley, who was serving his first presidential term: “McKinley has no more backbone than a chocolate éclair.” (And, yes, I also wondered, with all the talk lately about hand size and such, whether this éclair was really just an éclair. Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris assures me that “TR was, alas, incapable of double-entendres.” I still choose to believe Trump is not actually the first of our presidents to allude to declare his is firmer, if not bigger.) When not questioning their opponents’ “spines,” our forebears questioned each other’s brains: “That Washington is not a scholar is certain,” John Adams said. “That he is too illiterate, unlearned, unread for his station is equally beyond dispute.” Jefferson agreed and advised ambassador to France James Monroe to tell the French to essentially ignore Washington because he was senile.Lincoln — the now revered and idolized Lincoln that Republican candidates are falling over themselves to admire — also wasn’t considered terribly bright. “Buffoon,” “Ignoramus Abe” and “well-meaning baboon” (a phrase with clear racial overtones) were some of the names Lincoln’s critics summoned during his 1860 campaign against Stephen Douglas. And Lincoln, in turn, said of Douglas, “His argument is as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that has been starved to death.” (The idea that Lincoln was uneducated, bordering on illiterate, followed him into the White House. After a certain speech in Gettysburg, Pa., the Chicago Times wrote, “We did not conceive it possible that even Mr. Lincoln would produce a paper so slipshod, so loose-joined, so puerile, not alone in literary construction, but in its ideas, its sentiments, its grasp. He has outdone himself.” So there’s that.)They have basically called their opponents insane: “Pathological,” Trump said of Ben Carson, before the former surgeon dropped out and endorsed the businessman.It was hardly the first time the sanity of a powerful politician has been questioned. There was, as already noted, Jefferson calling Washington senile and concerns that Lincoln suffered from what had not yet been named “depression” and agreement among critics that “Bloody” Andrew Jackson was probably simply crazy. Then, in 1964, a survey of members of the American Psychiatric Association found that more than half of respondents believed that Republican candidate Barry Goldwater was clinically insane. (Their suggested diagnoses included “megalomaniac, paranoid, and grossly psychotic … schizophrenia.”)This led to the establishment of the “Goldwater Rule,” in which the APA’s ethics requirements ban psychiatrists from commenting about any individual who they have not actually treated. There are exceptions if you add caveats and disclaimers, though, and this election cycle includes a Vanity Fair article in which psychologists and social workers opine that the Republican frontrunner is “actually a narcissist.”They flirted — and more — with violence: Trump has boasted that he could stand “in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters.” Andrew Jackson kind of did. Estimates of his duel participation tally vary from a dozen to several hundred, but there was at least one in which the other guy died. That would be Charles Dickinson, a rival breeder of racehorses, who accused Jackson of reneging on a bet, and also brought up the bigamy thing. Voters seemed to agree that Jackson had been insulted and was simply defending his honor.Trump has also warned there may be riots if he is denied the Republican nomination, and that too has happened. In 1912, supporters of Theodore Roosevelt and those of Howard Taft brought bats, guns and even dynamite onto the convention floor. And the possibility that a spurned candidate could “take his voters and go home” in a third-party run has also happened, that same year in fact, when Roosevelt left the convention, booked a ballroom across town and declared himself the nominee of what came to be known as the Bull Moose Party.They predicted the end of the republic: All this bad behavior was justified by the fear that the target of that behavior was a threat to the future of the country. Whether that was truly felt or simply manufactured is between each politician and his conscience, but the case was continually made that the other guy would destroy America.Usually that didn’t happen. During the election of 1800, for instance, one editorial warned that should Jefferson win, voters should be “prepared to see your dwellings in flames … female chastity violated, or children writhing on the pike.”Sometimes, though, the alarmists were right. Rabble-rousing crowds did swarm unfettered, after Jackson’s election — trampling the public quarters of the White House on Inauguration Day, breaking furniture and china while trying to get to the free refreshments. (Eventually the bowls of punch were moved onto the lawn and the mobs followed.)And then there were those who said the election of Abraham Lincoln would literally lead to the disintegration of the United States. It did. At least for a while.I explain all this to the 20-somethings, and they have more questions — mostly about whether they should fear civil war.Again, I try to put things in historical context. Most of the time, I remind them, the worst actors never actually won the presidency. William Randolph Hearst (a newspaper magnate, with more money than couth, who spent the modern equivalent of $54 million of his own money on a presidential campaign in 1904) never got the nomination. Theodore Roosevelt’s third-party bid was unsuccessful. Goldwater was soundly defeated. The American electorate has regularly shown itself able to pull up before impact.Oh, they say, then historians aren’t worried? So I don’t have to be?Not exactly. As Doris Kearns Goodwin put it recently on “Meet the Press”: “As a historian, I might say, ‘200 years from now, a historian will be able to detail this the way I couldn’t.’ But as a citizen, it’s pretty scary and sad.”Yes, this may have happened in the past, she and others say, but that doesn’t make it OK when it happens now. Norms and standards have changed over the centuries, and our leaders are expected to change too. More is at stake in the modern world, where nations are dependent on the U.S. economically and militarily. And unlike even a few election cycles ago, every imprudent utterance goes out to that world unfiltered.“For many decades most of what was ‘published’ — broadcast on television or radio, printed in books, newspapers and magazines — was edited, reviewed by a person or more often a group of people, an editorial staff, whose entire purpose was to exert judiciousness,” Lepore says. Most recently, though, “nearly all of what is ‘published’ — posted, tweeted, blogged, televised, dash-camed — is unedited. There is media, but it no longer mediates.”What then to tell the 20-somethings?“I don’t know what you tell to young people,” admits Ellis, who teaches many of them at Mount Holyoke. “You can tell them the republic is not going to go out of existence, I am pretty sure of that. The good thing about history is we’ve seen worse and survived it. But what things will look like after this mess” of a campaign? “I have no idea.”What he said._______Yahoo News graphics photo credits: Background images: AP, Getty.

Trump returns to New York amid rumors of campaign turmoil,271,"Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally Wednesday in Bethpage, N.Y. (Photo: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)BETHPAGE, N.Y. — A day after losing Wisconsin’s Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump brought his insurgent campaign to New York Wednesday night, kicking off a bid to win his home state primary with a massive rally that harkened back to the early days of his unlikely presidential effort.“It’s great to be home,” Trump declared in a massive movie studio soundstage in the heart of Long Island that was packed with at least 10,000 people — one of his biggest rallies in more than a month. “I love New York. … I love this city, I love this country, and we are going to start winning again.”Trump was referring to his campaign line “make America great again,” but the line also could have applied to his campaign, which seemed mired in turmoil Wednesday amid reports of staff infighting as the real estate mogul strives to win the 1,237 delegates needed to stave off a contested convention this July.Supporters cheer as Trump speaks during a campaign event at Grumman Studios in Bethpage. (Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Several news outlets, including Politico and CNN, reported that Paul Manafort, a Trump senior adviser recently hired to oversee the campaign’s convention and delegate efforts, met with Trump Wednesday to insist on a more coherent campaign strategy. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on the reports, which also suggested a diminishing role for Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s embattled campaign manager.SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>Adding to the intrigue are questions over the candidate’s upcoming schedule. He had been expected to travel all week, including to Colorado, which holds its state GOP convention this weekend. But as of Wednesday night, the candidate had just one event on his schedule for the remainder of the week: a press conference set for Friday afternoon in Los Angeles.But there was good news for Trump. As he formally kicked off his New York campaign, a new Monmouth poll released Wednesday found 52 percent of likely GOP voters are backing Trump ahead of the state’s April 19 primary. Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in second, with 25 percent, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz trailed with 17 percent support.People protest against Trump as a crowd leaves the site of the candidate’s campaign appearance in Bethpage. (Photo: Craig Ruttle/AP)Trump, who almost always brings up poll numbers in his stump speech, was beside himself as he cited the poll Wednesday night. “A poll came out that was through the roof,” Trump bragged. “You know what makes me happiest, when the people that know me best — and boy, do you know me well — when the people that know you the best … give you poll numbers that nobody can believe.”Though he made no mention of his loss in Wisconsin on Tuesday night, Trump renewed his attacks on Cruz, describing him as a phony beholden to special interests. And he beamed when the crowd at one point began chanting “Lyin’ Ted,” Trump’s favorite nickname for his bitter rival.“Make sure you spell it right,” Trump said, with a huge grin on his face. “It’s L-Y-I-N apostrophe. Lyin’ Ted.”Supporters reach out for signatures, photos and handshakes as Trump greets the crowd after speaking at Grumman Studios. (Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)"
Bernie Sanders bobbled foreign policy in that Daily News interview,2334,"Bernie Sanders speaks to supporters about foreign policy in March in Salt Lake City. (Photo: John Locher/Associated Press)Bernie Sanders doesn’t know whether President Obama’s signature counterterrorism strategy, drone strikes, is the right approach to the problem. Fifteen years into a bitter national debate about Guantanamo Bay, he hasn’t thought much about where he would imprison and interrogate a captured terrorist leader. He can’t explain his call for Israel to pull back from some settlements on Palestinian land because he doesn’t have “some paper” in front of him. He also can’t say why he doesn’t support Palestinians taking action against Israel before the International Criminal Court.Those are all takeaways from a New York Daily News interview with Sanders, whose long-shot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has surprised many observers by mounting a real challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.The Vermont senator’s potent message to voters in 2016 has focused on economic issues, arguing that the very rich have rigged the system in their favor with the help of venal politicians. He has marketed himself as the candidate who will upend the system and has leveraged that appeal into an unlikely string of primary victories, in part thanks to a well-organized campaign ground game and an online machinery that is without peer in the Senate.He never intended to focus on international relations.As late as August 2015, when Yahoo News looked at how Sanders would handle foreign policy, his official campaign website did not even have a section on world affairs — though his team has since added one. Sanders has relied on one weapon in his national security duel with Clinton: She voted in favor of authorizing George W. Bush to go to war in Iraq; he voted against it. That argument worked for Obama in 2008, the senator’s aides seem to think, so why not now?SLIDESHOW – The battle for New York >>>Clinton, who rarely misses a chance to refer to her crisis meetings with Obama in the White House Situation Room and peppers her national security remarks with names of foreign leaders she has met, isn’t invulnerable on foreign policy. Far from it.But what the awkward Daily News interview confirms is that she has little to fear on that score from the iconoclastic senator from Vermont.The April 1 question-and-answer session came just a couple of weeks after Sanders laid out his Middle East policy in a detailed speech in Utah that seemed designed to show fluency in world affairs, whatever one might think of the policy particulars. There were common themes to both sets of remarks — defeating the Islamic State requires Muslim ground troops, Middle East peace requires compromises from all sides, etc. But the Sanders who turned up for the interview seemed to have lost fluency on some central questions for candidates vying to be commander in chief.Sanders repeated his call for Israel to hold off from building new settlements in the West Bank and to pull back from some existing ones that he called “illegal.”The Daily News asked how much Israel should pull back.“You’re asking me a very fair question, and if I had some paper in front of me, I would give you a better answer,” Sanders replied. “But I think if the expansion was illegal, moving into territory that was not their territory, I think withdrawal from those territories is appropriate.”So, if the United States were to determine that some settlements are illegal under existing treaties and agreements, then a Sanders administration would expect Israel to pull back?“Israel will make their own decisions,” Sanders replied.The Daily News continued, asking him if he supports the Palestinian leadership’s efforts to drag Israel before the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes.No, said Sanders. “Why not?” the Daily News asked.“Look, why don’t I support a million things in the world? I’m just telling you that I happen to believe,” said the senator, who went on to say that Israel’s military had engaged in indiscriminate bombings of Palestinians but never said why he opposed bringing in the ICC.Turning to drone strikes, the Daily News incorrectly said Obama had taken the program away from the CIA and given it to the military, then noted the yearslong controversy over the tactic.“Do you believe that he’s got the right policy there?” the editorial board asked.“I don’t know the answer to that. What I do know is that drones are a modern weapon,” Sanders said.The senator noted that civilian casualties from drone strikes undermine U.S. goals and urged that “whoever is in control of that policy, it has to be refined so that we are killing the people we want to kill and not innocent collateral damage.” (Sanders would have been on firmer ground simply by starting his answer with the mixed assessment he delivered, which echoes some of Obama’s own public remarks about drones.)Marines and a detainee at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002. (Photo: Marc Serota/Reuters)Where would a Sanders administration imprison and interrogate a captured Islamic State commander?“Actually I haven’t thought about it a whole lot,” the senator answered. Sanders went on to say that such prisoners should be held in a safe, secure locale, ideally not far from where they were captured, and that he was open to jailing them on U.S. soil.That’s seen as a necessary position for anyone who supports closing the detention center for suspected extremists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sanders the presidential candidate supports doing so, while Sanders the senator’s record is mixed.Sanders isn’t as much of a foreign policy cipher as his opponent and many commentators suggest. He’s not a pacifist, and while he tends to oppose military interventions, he backed the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and voted in favor of giving President Bill Clinton the authority to carry out airstrikes against Serbian targets in Yugoslavia in 1999. He supports the Iran nuclear deal. He opposes Obama’s sweeping trade agreement with Pacific nations. He’s more supportive of the president’s approach to Syria than Clinton, who has called for establishing and defending no-fly zones and repeatedly noted that she favored arming Syrian rebels while Obama did not.But with the Daily News interview, Sanders played into the hands of critics who charge he simply isn’t interested in or informed about foreign affairs. The Clinton campaign didn’t hesitate to send the transcript of Sanders’ interview to its mass email list."
Florida Gov. Rick Scott gets an earful at Starbucks: ‘You’re an embarrassment to our state!’,6542,"Florida Gov. Rick Scott was simply trying to place his Starbucks order. He got an expletive-laced earful instead.Scott was in line at the coffee chain’s downtown Gainesville location on Tuesday when a female customer working on her laptop noticed the governor — and promptly went off on him.“You cut Medicaid, so I couldn’t get Obamacare,” the woman, later identified as Cara Jennings, yelled. “You’re an a**hole.”The unpopular Republican governor, whose approval rating stands at just 38 percent in the Sunshine State, tried to explain that he didn’t actually cut Medicaid — he refused to expand it.But that explanation didn’t satisfy Jennings.“You don’t care about working people,” she said. “You should be ashamed to show your face around here.”Scott countered by pointing out that he has created “a million jobs” during his tenure as governor.“A million jobs? Great,” Jennings said. “Who here has a great job?”“You should,” Scott replied.Jeri Bustamante, the governor’s spokeswoman, approached Jennings to intervene. But Bustamante was quickly rebuffed.“I’m not talking to you,” Jennings said, laying into the governor over a recently signed anti-abortion bill that cuts all state funding to abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, and redefines trimesters.“You stripped women of access to public health care. Shame on you, Rick Scott. We depend on those services,” she said.“Maybe you should try to tell the truth,” Scott interjected.“Rich people like you don’t know what to do when poor people like us need health services; you cut ’em,” Jennings concluded. “Shame on you, Rick Scott. You’re an embarrassment to our state!”(Cover thumbnail photo: Steve Cannon/AP)"
Hillary Clinton says she isn’t sure Bernie Sanders is a Democrat,6828,"Bernie Sanders says he is making Hillary Clinton “nervous.” While that may or may not be true, his popularity with younger voters is clearly annoying her.“There is a persistent, organized effort to misrepresent my record, and I don’t appreciate that,” Clinton told Politico in a podcast interview published Wednesday. “And I feel sorry for a lot of the young people who are fed this list of misrepresentations.”On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Clinton was asked why she hasn’t been able to attract the kind of voters that pack the Vermont senator’s rallies.“Look, I think it’s exciting to be, in effect, protesting,” Clinton said. “I did that a long time ago when I was in my 20s, and I totally get the attraction of this.”Sanders’ attacks on former President Bill Clinton are also irking the Democratic frontrunner.“I know that Sen. Sanders spends a lot of time attacking my husband, attacking President Obama,” she told Politico. “I rarely hear him say anything negative about George W. Bush, who I think wrecked our economy.”What’s more, Clinton says she isn’t sure Sanders is a real Democrat.“I can’t answer that,” Clinton said. “He’s a relatively new Democrat, and, in fact, I’m not even sure he is one. He’s running as one. So I don’t know quite how to characterize him. I’ll leave that to him.”Things are getting testy in the race for the Democratic nomination. (Photos: Reuters/AP)The independent senator and self-described democratic socialist beat the former secretary of state in Tuesday’s Wisconsin primary — his sixth victory in the last seven states. But while Sanders may have momentum, Clinton retains a lead in both pledged and unpledged delegates in the race for the Democratic nomination.On Tuesday, Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver was asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper what his message would be to the Clinton campaign.“Don’t destroy the Democratic party to satisfy the secretary’s ambitions to become president of the United States,” Weaver said. “You want to have a party at the end of this we can unify.”“I have been campaigning for Democrats, fundraising for Democrats, recruiting Democrats to run and win for a really long time — I think about 40 years. Senator Sanders, by his own admission, has never even been a Democrat.”So why can’t she seem to shake him?Part of the problem, Clinton believes, is that while she’s a better candidate than the one who lost to Obama in 2008, she’s not “a natural politician.”“I hope I’m a better candidate. I feel like I am. I mean … I’m not a natural politician,” Clinton told Politico. “I’m not somebody who, like my husband or Barack Obama, [where it’s] just — it’s music, right? I am someone who loves doing the job that I have. I would love having the job of president because I know how to do it. I know what the country needs. But the campaigning part is hard for me.”Looking ahead to a possible general election matchup with Donald Trump, Clinton — who attended Trump’s 2005 wedding — says she doesn’t know him that well, a point that came into focus during the launch of his presidential campaign.“He was always somebody who, oh, liked attention, liked to express his opinion,” Clinton said. “But I was shocked when he came out the very first day and called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. That just shocked me. I was thinking to myself, ‘Where did that come from?’”“I believe that what he is saying now is very destructive,” she continued. “It’s not only offensive, it’s dangerous. I believe it has repercussions for our relations with other countries, how we are viewed, because I learned, in depth, what I had suspected when I was secretary of state. The way that other nations, both people and leaders, follow our presidential election is intense. And so we think of a throw-away comment; they think it’s a change in direction.”Clinton added: “I think it’s fair to say there is a demagogic path that Europeans, South Americans, Asians have pursued, and we know where that leads. It uses xenophobia, it uses paranoia, it uses prejudice, it uses nationalism to really stir people up and to, you know, begin an us-versus-them contrast, which is dangerous and is not something we’ve had in our politics at a presidential level.”What about Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who predicted he would be the Republican nominee after winning Wednesday’s Wisconsin GOP primary?“I think he is a very, you know, mean-spirited guy,” Clinton said. “You can see it from how the Republican Party responds to him.”"
"Trump falters in Wisconsin, as Cruz wins big",2903,"NEW YORK — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz soundly defeated Donald Trump in Wisconsin’s Republican presidential primary Tuesday, winning close to 50 percent of the vote in a three-man contest and potentially giving a burst of new energy to efforts to stop the real estate mogul from clinching the GOP nomination. The outcome appeared to increase the odds of a contested convention this summer.“Tonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry,” Cruz declared at his primary night party in Milwaukee. “We have a choice, a real choice.”But it was too soon to tell whether Cruz’s victory was a sign that the #NeverTrump movement is truly gaining steam, or if it was merely a bump in the road for Trump, who has spent the last several days trying to regain the offensive after a series of self-inflicted wounds to his campaign.While exit polls showed that Trump had won among moderates, and preliminary results showed him doing well in rural parts of the state — where he had been expected to do best — there were some troubling signs for his campaign. Among them were Cruz’s decisive wins among women and suburban voters, two constituencies Trump has struggled to win so far.Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, left, celebrate his victory at a campaign event Tuesday in Milwaukee. (Photo: Paul Sancya/AP)Slideshow: Primary day in Wisconsin >>>Those two voting blocs could be pivotal as the race shifts toward Northeastern states such as New York. This is considered favorable terrain for Trump, but Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who came in a distant third in Wisconsin, are looking to peel off as many delegates as possible to stop him from winning the nomination outright.Assisted by an endorsement from Gov. Scott Walker, Cruz easily won a key GOP stronghold in Wisconsin: the suburbs of Milwaukee, home to college-educated, middle-class Republicans. The loss underscores the difficulty Trump has had winning over suburban Republicans in the contest so far, including in Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia, states he easily won overall but where he lost in the suburbs of major cities.That’s a worrying trend for Trump in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maryland, where the Republican electorate is largely suburban and where Trump needs to win to avoid a floor fight at the convention.While initial results suggested Cruz would win most of Wisconsin’s 42 delegates, Trump still leads the Texas senator by at least 200 delegates. But another hint of trouble came in the exit polls, which found that 58 percent of those who had voted reported that they were “concerned” or “scared” about the prospect of Trump winning the presidency.Trump has tried to position himself as the eventual GOP nominee, bragging that he can be a unifying force in the party even as he has struggled with discipline in what has been one of the toughest weeks of his candidacy so far, after several political missteps that unquestionably hurt his campaign in Wisconsin.Among them were his fumbling answers on abortion — including a call for “punishment” for women who undergo an abortion if it were to be made illegal, which he later walked back — and his retweet of a supporter’s unflattering post of a photo of Cruz’s wife, Heidi. Trump also faced criticism for his defense of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who has been charged with simple battery for allegedly grabbing a female reporter during a campaign event last month.Sen. Ted Cruz embraces his wife, Heidi, at his Wisconsin primary night rally Tuesday in Milwaukee. (Photo: Jim Young/Reuters)Cruz quickly sought to take advantage of Trump’s flubs, holding several events in recent days to directly appeal to female voters, who, polls suggest, have been alienated by Trump’s behavior and rhetoric. On Monday, Cruz held a campaign event with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, with whom Trump has had repeated run-ins during the campaign. Cruz suggested his rival has a problem with “strong women” — a phrase he repeated in his victory speech Tuesday night.It’s a phrase Cruz is likely to use again as the race shifts toward mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states like New York and Pennsylvania, where women make up a major part of the Republican electorate. If Trump can’t win those states outright, his path to win the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination grows ever more difficult.Trump, who is scheduled to kick off his New York campaign with a rally in Long Island on Wednesday, is still trying to unite the party behind his bid and cast himself as a more serious candidate. In recent days, he’s held smaller rallies, trying to project a calmer presence, and he has resisted engaging with protesters. On Tuesday, his campaign told the Washington Post he would deliver a series of policy speeches in coming weeks as he looks toward the general election.Still, Trump couldn’t resist lashing out on Wednesday, portraying his share of the vote (about one-third, based on incomplete returns), as a victory against his critics. The statement, attributed to his campaign and not to the candidate personally, railed against “Lyin’ Ted Cruz” and accused the senator of illegally coordinating with super-PACs, “who totally control him.”“Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again,” the statement said. “Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet — he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.”A Trump poster is left on the seats after a campaign event in Milwaukee.

Sanders keeps on winning — and losing,1981,"Sen. Bernie Sanders is on a roll.Sanders was projected the winner in Wisconsin’s Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday night. It was his sixth victory in the last seven states. Sanders also won the primary for Democrats living abroad, which was announced on March 21. However, he still faces an uphill battle against his rival, Hillary Clinton.While Sanders has performed well in the Midwest and Western states, Clinton’s earlier dominance, particularly in the South, has given her a delegate lead that her campaign has dubbed “nearly insurmountable.”In spite of the long odds, Sanders and his campaign believe his current momentum can propel him across the finish line. In a fundraising email to supporters shortly after media outlets first projected his victory, Sanders noted the pessimistic forecasts many political observers have made for his campaign.“The corporate media and political establishment keep counting us out, but we keep winning states and doing so by large margins. If we can keep this up, we’re going to shock them all and win this nomination,” Sanders said.Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won the Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin on Tuesday, gestures to supporters during a campaign rally in Laramie, Wyo. (Photo: Brennan Linsley/AP)Wisconsin, with its large college population and tradition of progressive politics, has long been seen as fertile ground for Sanders. Most polls in the state showed him with a single-digit lead over Clinton heading into Tuesday’s election. However, Clinton’s existing lead and the fact that the state awards delegates by congressional district means Sanders will have to win by a much larger margin to make a dent in Clinton’s pledged delegate lead.Whatever his margin of victory, his recent streak culminating with the win in Wisconsin certainly gives Sanders strong momentum heading into Wyoming’s caucuses on Saturday and the delegate-rich primary in New York on April 19. But the battle for the Democratic nomination won’t just be about the voters and the pledged delegates who are awarded based on ballots cast.Indeed, momentum was the main theme of the victory speech Sanders delivered from an event in Laramie, Wyo., on Tuesday night. Sanders said the fact he had emerged as a serious challenger to Clinton after being behind in the polls and dismissed by many pundits demonstrates the true strength of his campaign. He also pointed to the fact that he has managed to build a substantial war chest without the help of super-PACs, which allow wealthy megadonors to back campaigns.Supporters cheer while waiting for Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in Laramie, Wyo., on Tuesday. (Photo: Brennan Linsley/AP)Slideshow: Primary day in Wisconsin >>>“What momentum is about is my belief that if we wake up the American people, that if working people, and middle-class people, and senior citizens, and young people begin to stand up, fight back and come out and vote in large numbers, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish,” Sanders said.Clinton attended a private fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday night and is not likely to make a public address.Clinton has amassed a massive lead among Democratic superdelegates, who are not bound to vote at the party’s convention based on the results of their states’ primaries. Sanders and his campaign are hoping his recent wins can help convince some of these superdelegates to change sides. His team and supporters are lobbying superdelegates, particularly in states where he won decisive victories over Clinton, and arguing it would be undemocratic for them to go against the will of the electorate.Hillary Clinton takes a selfie with a supporter after speaking at a “Women for Hillary” town hall event in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on Tuesday.

At an event in Elmont, N.Y., on Tuesday morning, Yahoo News asked President Clinton about the superdelegate system and the frequently voiced criticism that it is unfair. Though he answered questions from reporters after a similar event in New York City last Thursday, Clinton was somewhat less forthcoming when Yahoo News asked about his role as a superdelegate.“I don’t answer questions on a rope line, but I got a good answer for you,” President Clinton said.

(Photo: Jeff Chiu/AP)By Michael WalshBy losing PayPal, North Carolina might have just suffered the most palpable financial consequence of having a law that many consider discriminatory against transgender people.The California-based online payment company announced Tuesday that it is abandoning its plan to set up a new $3.6 million global operations center in Charlotte, N.C., which it said would have employed more than 400 people in skilled jobs.Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal, said House Bill 2 (HB2) invalidates protections of rights for LGBT citizens and denies them equal rights under the law.“This decision reflects PayPal’s deepest values and our strong belief that every person has the right to be treated equally, and with dignity and respect,” Schulman wrote in a statement. “These principles of fairness, inclusion and equality are at the heart of everything we seek to achieve and stand for as a company. And they compel us to take action to oppose discrimination.”He said PayPal regrets that it will not have the opportunity to become part of the Charlotte community and work with the region’s many talented people.“While we will seek an alternative location for our operations center,” Schulman continued, “we remain committed to working with the LGBT community in North Carolina to overturn this discriminatory legislation, alongside all those who are committed to equality.”LGBT activists march against House Bill 2 in Chapel Hill, N.C. (Photo: Whitney Keller/The Herald-Sun via AP)Under HB2, people in North Carolina are only permitted to use public restrooms that correspond with their biological sex, defined as “the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.” The bill also forbids local governments from passing local ordinances that would outlaw discrimination against particular groups of people.Proponents of HB2 argue that it would stop violent men from sneaking into women’s restrooms to sexually assault them. Opponents of HB2 argue that this is a scare tactic to legalize discrimination.Many businesses have already spoken out against the bill. PayPal’s announcement comes just days after Lionsgate pulled the plug on filming a new Hulu show in Charlotte.The Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBT rights in the state, said PayPal is sending a loud and clear message to North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, who signed HB2 into law on March 23.“With every passing day that HB2 remains on the books, Governor McCrory is inflicting damage on the state’s economy and reputation,” Griffin said in a news release. “The fact also remains that this destructive and appalling bill continues to put people across the state at risk of harm and discrimination. It is time for Governor McCrory to stop this senseless crusade against equality and repeal HB2 once and for all.”The North Carolina Family Policy Council, a conservative nonprofit supporting HB2, argued that the Human Rights Campaign and other activist groups have manufactured this outrage on behalf of the “LGBT agenda.”“Far from an ‘organic’ outrage by the business community, you have to hand it to the Human Rights Campaign for orchestrating a masterful PR and lobbying campaign against House Bill 2,” NCFPC president John Rustin wrote.Lawmakers in North Carolina approved HB2 in March to counteract an ordinance passed by the Charlotte City Council that prohibited discrimination against LGBT people and affirmed the right of transgender people to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity."
It’s all up to YOU! The art of the campaign fundraising email,45,"Photo: Jae C. Hong/AP Photo.As the remaining presidential candidates enter the third month of primary voting, the tones of their campaigns have added a tinge of desperation. Pleas for support at rallies have become louder; digs at competitors harsher, and — most notably — voters have been besieged by fundraising emails all the more frequently.And just as candidates hone their ground-game strategies in the primary states, they are refining their approaches to digital communication. Ahead of today’s primary election in Wisconsin, where both races are tight, Yahoo News asked three digital marketing experts to critique some sample fundraising emails.Our test subject? Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who is currently polling ahead of frontrunner Donald Trump for tonight’s primary. Cruz has cultivated an extensive grassroots fundraising effort, pulling in $54.7 million as of February — far more than his two remaining opponents. Below is the verdict on the (apparently effective) subject lines and language of a few of the Texas senator’s campaign emails. (no subject)Though one would hope that a possible future president would be more explicit if he had something to email to, say, Vladimir Putin, the “no subject” subject line has emerged as a common ploy in digital marketing.“You see this in emails happening a lot more frequently lately, where people will put ‘Fwd’ or ‘Re:’ or ‘no subject,’” Isla McKetta, a content creator at the Seattle-based marketing company Moz, told Yahoo News. “It’s an attempt to be kind of casual or off-the-cuff.”Piquing the curiosity of a recipient can sometimes be more effective than being straightforward. According to Cathy McPhillips, a vice president at the Content Marketing Institute, emails without subject lines have an 8 percent higher open rate than emails with subject lines, typically because people associate such messages from close friends or family members. “People just want to know what it is,” McPhillips told Yahoo News. sorry for the late noteIn line with the same sort of casual outreach that President Obama made famous in his 2008 campaign, email fundraising teams are keen to maintain an aura of an intimacy between a candidate and voters. Sometimes that means purposefully keeping text all lowercase while offering an absurd apology for sending a note that most readers will not see until the morning. In other cases, it means stretching the truth to say the sender is “Ted Cruz’s iPad,” even if the message is being sent from the same standard email address attributed to other emails.“They’re basically saying, ‘Ted is a real person, he’s not just some political robot, and he’s communicating with you one on one with these messages,’” Joe Stych, an email marketing manager at the web automation app Zapier, told Yahoo News. “If you have an editor writing something, they’ll put it in title case. If you have Ted Cruz typing away on his iPad, then he’s probably not going to correct his capitalization. I’m pretty sure the iPad would correct it for him, but we just won’t go there.”Though this level of dishonesty might turn off those recipients still unsure about who they plan to vote for, McKetta says that diehard Cruz-heads probably wouldn’t be bothered by this tactic.“Lots of people would be willing to suspend their disbelief enough in order to open it,” she said. “If you support a candidate enough to sign up for their emails, you care, you are involved, and you want to believe that Ted cares about you.” (ACTION REQUIRED) Cruz Crew: Make Phone Calls for TedIn many cases, campaigns use subject lines that stir a level of emotion or urgency, the same way a click-baity Daily Mail headline might. According to McKetta, you can often place them into a small set of categories.“I like to think about subject lines as having six different types: direct, playful, curiosity-inducing, personalized, scarcity and call to action,” she said. “This one is definitely a call to action. It’s very specific about what it’s doing: You know if you’re part of the Cruz Crew, and you know if you want to make phone calls for Ted.”Though McPhillips says pressing subject lines like these typically have higher open rates, Cruz’s campaign took a risk by including an all caps phrase in the subject line.“When things seem like they’re shouty or they’re hard to read, it usually backfires because it just becomes frustrating to the viewer,” she said. McPhillips also notes that using all caps, the word ‘free’ and exclamation points are the three simplest ways to trigger spam filters, causing the message to be lost to junk-mail purgatory.Fw: 9:16AMThis email requires some context: The full message includes an original note from Cruz with an actual voicemail attached to it, and appears to have been sent to the inbox of his wife, Heidi. She then forwarded it to some email subscribers, suggesting that at 9:16 a.m., they may have — gasp — missed an opportunity to personally speak with Cruz.“This email is just kind of strange,” Stych said. “It appears to have a voice message from Ted Cruz that somehow ended up in Heidi Cruz’s inbox, and she decided to forward it to you. It doesn’t really make any sense, to be honest.” Though it appears Cruz’s email managers were aiming to hit the same vague and personal sweet spot as a “no subject” line, Stych says that sometimes an imprecise subject line like this one can backfire. Using “Fw” ahead of the message is a way to establish a more intimate connection with recipients, but according to McPhillips, that method is considered a shady tactic among email marketers.“They’re using a lot of techniques that are on the list of the top five things you shouldn’t do in a subject line,” she said. “But because their goal is to get people to open it and spend five dollars, they’re doing whatever it takes.”FWD: [3] missed emailsIn this particular subject line, the Cruz campaign has tweaked its forwarding tactic so that the abbreviation is in all caps, and now has a ‘D.’ The difference in the two isn’t sloppiness, according to Synch; it’s likely a way to test which marker is more effective. “The forward with the ‘D’ and the forward without the ‘D’ is probably A/B testing to see which one is more opened,” he said. “They’re just trying to see which one works better.”When it comes to alerting recipients that they’ve missed three emails, couching the “3” in brackets to make it appear as if their email provider is trying to get their attention, McKetta says that Cruz’s team has once again walked into spammy territory. But it’s possible that, with the help of their own analytics, they have also have weighed the cost and benefits of this.“Email is very audience-specific, and it’s really hard to say without researching into Ted Cruz’s audience whether this would turn off subscribers,” McKetta said. “I’m sure that his campaign team has done that kind of research. But I would definitely be watching the unsubscribe rate after subject lines like this.”Ultimately, according to McPhillips, whether a politician offends an email subscriber may have less to do with the message and more to do with an individual’s attention span.“We have emails coming to us all day long from so many forces,” she said. “It is nice to see emails that are short and sweet: Here’s what we need, here’s why, and here’s a link. But then again, if I just had these in my inbox and not lined up in a row, I may not have been this critical.”"
Obama smacks down Trump’s border wall plan,6384,"President Obama on Tuesday bluntly dismissed Donald Trump’s proposal to force Mexico to pay for a border wall as “half-baked” and counterproductive and said the Republican frontrunner’s “wackier” foreign policy ideas were hurting the United States abroad.In a memo obtained by the Washington Post, Trump said he would threaten to cut off money transfers from workers inside the United States — including U.S. citizens — to relatives in Mexico unless that country makes a one-time payment of $5 billion to $10 billion to pay for the construction of a 1,000-mile border fence.Obama, speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room, said that doing so could cause “enormous” damage to Mexico’s economy, which depends on those transfers, usually known as remittances. The proposal is also “impractical,” he said.“The notion that we’re going to track every Western Union bit of money that’s being sent to Mexico — you know, good luck with that,” Obama said derisively. “Then we’ve got the issue of the implications for the Mexican economy, which, in turn, if it’s collapsing, actually sends more immigrants north because they can’t find jobs back in Mexico.”President Obama reacts to a question while delivering remarks on the economy in the White House press briefing room. (Photo: Gary Cameron/Reuters)Trump’s plan “is just one more example of something that is not thought through and is primarily put forward for political consumption,” Obama said.World leaders “don’t expect half-baked notions coming out of the White House. We can’t afford that,” the president said. “I am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made.”Obama said he was hearing worries over proposals from Trump as well as his nearest rival for the GOP nomination, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Cruz’s ideas “in some ways are just as draconian when it comes to immigration, for example,” Obama said."
Obama hasn’t endorsed any Bernie Sanders backers,26,"President Obama arrives on Air Force One with Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Fla., and Rep. Corinne Brown, D-Fla., at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Fla., Friday, Feb. 26, 2016. (Photo: Rick Wilson/AP)President Obama has endorsed 12 candidates for political office in 2015 and 2016. He has openly backed incumbents and first-timers, candidates for mayor, for the Illinois Statehouse, for the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, candidates running from Ohio to Florida. Some face contested Democratic primaries. Others never did, or won their primaries and are now looking toward the November election.Obama’s chosen candidates are all Democrats, of course. But they share another trait: Not one has openly endorsed Bernie Sanders for president.In fact, of the 12, five have endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the others have remained officially uncommitted.It’s not clear whether this is part of a strategy or whether Obama sees candidates running further to the party’s left as less viable candidates in the general election. White House officials declined to go on the record to discuss the president’s criteria for granting an endorsement. And given the  relatively small number of candidates endorsing Sanders, it may not be especially meaningful to understanding how — or whom — Obama endorses.The president, who has never been more popular during his second term than he is right now, laid down one clear marker  in a January 7 New York Times op-ed. “I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform,” he said.Obama seems to have held to that standard, albeit with some flexibility. Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a longtime gun rights advocate, flipped on the issue in late 2015. In March, Obama endorsed Strickland, a longtime Clinton ally, in his primary fight, and the White House played down the Ohioan’s remarkable conversion on guns.“Obviously, an individual’s record matters, but when it came to that particular promise, it gave candidates the capacity to change their mind,” Obama’s press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters.One week later, Earnest explained Obama’s endorsements of Strickland and Rep. Patrick Murphy’s Senate bid by saying the president “has put his endorsement alongside who he believes are the strongest candidates in those two key states.” (Murphy’s rival for the Democratic senate nomination in Florida, liberal firebrand Alan Grayson, has endorsed Sanders.)Obama hasn’t made much of a secret that he’d prefer to see Clinton win the Democratic presidential nomination. Current and former aides say she, not Sanders, is best positioned to defend and build on his legacy. At the same time, they’ve said he does not plan to endorse either candidate during the Democratic presidential primary.To understand how the endorsement process works at the White House, Yahoo News spoke to aides to five candidates who have secured the president’s public support. None would agree to be quoted by name, or even described as working for a specific campaign, saying they did not want to offend the White House by laying bare a system so shrouded in secrecy that Obama aides won’t say how many Democrats have asked for the president’s endorsement.But that is the starting point for each presidential endorsement: A candidate has to ask for it.The West Wing’s political office, led by David Simas, takes stock of the candidate’s positions on major policy issues — whether they support Obama’s push for a Pacific trade deal, for instance, or his calls for new restrictions on gun ownership — as well as their viability in the primaries and the general election. One candidate’s aide said their boss’s long relationship with Obama also had been a factor.If the endorsement request gets the green light, the candidate’s team then works with Simas and his aides to draft the president’s statement, which is always announced by the endorsee’s campaign, not the White House. The result typically highlights the candidate’s position on key issues important to voters, or showcases parts of the candidate’s experience, and frequently includes a boilerplate promise that they’ll fight for middle-class interests if elected.“There’s a back and forth over the exact language — they’re very good and they know basically our issues, but maybe we know better what we want to highlight,” a senior aide to one candidate told Yahoo News. The statement was “tailored to fit our needs,” an aide to another candidate explained.After that, it’s up to the individual endorsee to announce that he or she has Obama’s support.Murphy “has been a tireless champion for middle-class families and a defender of the economic progress that American workers and businesses have made,” Obama said in his endorsement. “In Congress, he’s fought to strengthen Medicare and Social Security, reform our criminal justice system and protect a woman’s right to choose. Floridians can count on Patrick Murphy to stand up for them every day as their next senator.”“Katie is a true champion for working families, with a proven record of taking on big challenges and delivering for people,” Obama said in his endorsement of Katie McGinty, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania.“She spent her entire career working to promote clean energy and combat climate change, and worked closely with my administration to implement the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicaid coverage to more than 500,000 Pennsylvanians,” he added. “I know Katie will take that same tenacity and drive with her to the Senate to ensure affordable, available heath care, to protect Social Security and Medicare and to uphold and enforce Wall Street reforms.”Aides to two candidates said they hoped the president’s endorsement would help with fundraising. An adviser to another candidate said he hoped the endorsement would help them squeak out a win in a difficult primary. All five aides said an Obama endorsement virtually guaranteed one day of overwhelmingly positive news coverage — the president has a roughly 52 percent job approval rating overall, but consistently scores in the 80s among Democrats.That doesn’t mean it’s always only a positive. Obama’s March 28 endorsement of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whom he installed in 2011 as head of the Democratic National Committee, led to speculation that the Sanders-supporting Florida professor challenging her, Tim Canova, posed more of a political threat to her than previously acknowledged.Obama called Wasserman Schultz “a strong, progressive leader in Congress,” adding that “she always stands up and fights for what is right for her district while passionately supporting middle-class families” — an apparent effort to defuse the assault from her left.The result? Canova posted strong fundraising figures in the first three months of 2016, a $557,000 haul that included $100,000 pulled in during the last four days of the quarter — money raised right after Obama’s endorsement of his opponent."
Tim Robbins compares Hillary Clinton supporters to ‘sheep’,5294,"Bernie Sanders stands with Tim Robbins at a campaign rally in Green Bay, Wis., on Monday. (Photo: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters)While introducing Bernie Sanders at a rally on the eve of the Wisconsin primary, actor Tim Robbins compared supporters of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton to sheep.“We’ve all been fed a steady stream of simplistic propaganda that furthers the establishment’s narrative that Hillary’s the presumptive nominee,” Robbins told the crowd in Green Bay, Wis., on Monday. “And if we were sheep, if we had gotten in line, there’d be no problem now.”The 57-year-old Academy Award winner, best known for his roles in “The Shawshank Redemption,” “Mystic River” and “Bull Durham,” called Clinton an “establishment figure” whose pragmatism is at odds with the Vermont senator’s progressive ideals.“Times have changed,” he said. “We are done with compromising our ideals.”Robbins also pointed to then-Sen. Clinton’s 2002 vote in favor of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which Sanders opposed.“Tim Robbins is right,” Sanders said in his speech. “That war has been a disaster for our country and the Middle East in general. I voted against that war; Secretary Clinton voted for that war.”Robbins isn’t the only actor out stumping for Sanders. Susan Sarandon, Rosario Dawson and Mark Ruffalo are among the self-described democratic socialist’s most visible surrogates.At a rally in the Bronx on Thursday, Dawson slammed Clinton for suggesting Sanders’ call for the media to move on from Donald Trump’s “stupid remarks” on abortion showed he wasn’t serious about women’s rights.“Regardless of the fact that he’s always stood up for women’s rights, equal pay, equality, and is pro-choice — which the other Democratic candidate very well knows — there’s this rumor that because he’s saying we’re giving Trump too much time on the airwaves, and we need to stop feeding into that hate, and talking about the issues, that somehow that meant he doesn’t care about women’s issues,” Dawson said. “Shame on you, Hillary.”And Sarandon, Robbins’ former partner, stirred controversy last week when she said she wasn’t sure she’d vote for Clinton over Trump in the fall should both current frontrunners emerge as the nominees.In an interview with MSNBC, the 69-year-old Academy Award winner suggested her fellow Sanders supporters — many of them first-time voters — won’t turn out for Clinton in a general election because “they feel like she’s not authentic, that she’s a liar, that they don’t trust her, so what difference does it make?”Sarandon was asked if she was among them.“I don’t know,” she said. “I’m gonna see what happens.”“Well, you know, some people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately,” Sarandon explained. “If he gets in, then things will really explode.”After backlash, Sarandon clarified her comments, saying she “would never support Trump.”"
Trevor Noah asks Debbie Wasserman Schultz if Bernie Sanders ‘is being c***blocked by the DNC’,3403,"Since taking over for Jon Stewart last fall, “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah has — rightly or wrongly — been criticized for being soft when it comes to skewering the 2016 presidential race.But Noah did just that on Monday night when he asked his guest, Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, if Bernie Sanders “is being c***blocked by the DNC.”Wasserman Schultz quickly dismissed Noah’s suggestion.“You know, as powerful as that makes me feel, I’m not doing a very good job of rigging the outcome or blocking anyone from getting their message out,” she replied. “The reality is that I have a job as national party chair that is one that requires a thick skin. It requires me to be able to absorb the body blows so our candidates can stay above the fray.”The DNC leader defended the superdelegate process as an American election tradition.“We’ve had superdelegates since I graduated in high school in 1984,” she said. “[But] it’s voters that can and should determine that outcome, and they always have,”Wasserman Schultz also defended the sparse Democratic debate schedule. The DNC initially scheduled just six debates, compared to 26 in 2008 — a move critics say benefited Hillary Clinton.“From our standpoint, I want them debating every day,” she said. “And I bet my counterpart, [Republican National Committee Chairman] Reince Priebus, wants [the GOP candidates] to debate never. Because every time they open their mouth, they do something to alienate somebody else.”Debbie Wasserman Schultz appeared on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” on Monday. (Photo: Comedy Central)It’s not the first time the DNC has been accused of tipping the scales in favor of Clinton in the battle for the Democratic nomination. In December, the Sanders campaign filed a lawsuit against the party organization after the DNC announced it would block Sanders’ team from accessing its massive file of voter information following revelations that a software error allowed at least one Sanders staffer to access data from Clinton’s campaign.“The leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said at the time. “This is unacceptable. Individual leaders of the DNC can support Hillary Clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign — one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in modern history.”And Wasserman Schultz herself has been accused of being in the pocket of the former secretary of state.The Florida congresswoman, who served as the co-chair of Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, has been called a “Clinton surrogate” by Sanders’ grassroots supporters.In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in February, Wasserman Schultz suggested superdelegates are necessary to keep activists from steering the election.“What do you tell voters who are new to the process who say this makes them feel like it’s all rigged?” Tapper asked the DNC chair.“Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don’t have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists,” she replied."
Marco Rubio: I’m Not Interested In Being Vice President,555,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) didn’t get very far in his presidential bid, and he’s out of a Senate seat as of January. What’s next for him? It’s not being anybody’s running mate.“I have no intention of being vice president,” Rubio said in a Friday interview with Univision. “I’m always looking for a way to serve the nation, but I don’t believe that it will be as vice president and I’m really not seeking it, I’m not requesting it, and it won’t happen.”He said he’ll support whomever the Republican Party nominates for president, but beyond that, he doesn’t want to be involved in the 2016 race anymore.“I wanted to be president of the United States. It didn’t turn out that way. Voters decided otherwise and I will focus on my work here in the Senate because I have nine months left,” he said. “After that, later, as a private citizen, I will continue looking for a way to contribute to the cause of political conservatism.”It doesn’t sound like Rubio knows what he’ll do next. He said that he hasn’t had much time to think about it (really?) and that he’ll try to do something as a lawyer in the private sector. As for a return to politics, it’s up to a higher power.“I haven’t thought about aspirations for the future,” he said. “I like politics, I like serving the public, and we’ll see if God offers us another opportunity in the future.”If God is talking to Donald Trump, Rubio’s days in public office are over. The GOP presidential front-runner predicted in March that if Rubio ran for president and lost, he wouldn’t be able to run for office again in Florida or nationally.“I certainly don’t think that he would be considered by anybody as a vice president, and I don’t think he could ever run for governor or whatever he might want to run for in the future,” Trump said in an MSNBC interview. In a Fox interview later that day, Trump went even further: “If he goes forward and loses, it’s the end of his career.”Share this slide:"
Real Voters Ask All The Questions For This Senate Debate,7,"If you’ve been frustrated by presidential primary debates featuring questions by media personalities that skip issues that actually affect people’s lives, things may be about to change. On Monday, two Senate candidates will participate in a debate with questions submitted only by voters, not moderators. The so-called Open Debate in Orlando, Florida, between Reps. David Jolly (R-Fla.) and Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) will be the first of its kind. The format is the brainchild of the Open Debate Coalition, founded in 2008 by organizations across the political spectrum to advocate for presidential debates that better represent what people want to know. The coalition invited Grayson and Jolly to participate after the two candidates agreed to debate each other before their primaries for Florida’s open Senate seat this summer. Jolly, Grayson and a slew of other candidates are vying to replace Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who gave up his seat for his unsuccessful run for president. The race is one of a handful that will determine which party wins control of the Senate in November. “At a time of so much dismay about our campaign finance and voting laws, bottom-up Open Debates are a bright spot for our democracy — and we are proud to co-host Monday’s big Open Debate in Orlando,” said Adam Green and Stephanie Taylor, co-founders of the Progressive Change Institute. “This will empower regular people in an unprecedented way. We hope this historic event helps makes Open Debates the norm in the future, from state and local races to Congress and all the way up to president.”The Progressive Change Institute is co-sponsoring the debate with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform. Moderators will include hosts from the online news show “The Young Turks,” which is popular among progressives, and from the online news site Independent Journal Review, which is popular with conservatives. The moderators will draw roughly eight to 10 questions from the top 30 questions submitted by voters in Florida. Floridians, along with people outside the state, can vote on the questions, influencing which are trending on the debate website, where the event will be live streamed. More than 225,000 votes had been cast as of Friday afternoon. The question leading in the voting was, “Would you vote in favor of a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United?” In second place was, “What will you do in your position to keep Social Security and Medicare strong?” Other top questions ask about breaking up big banks, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, voting and reproductive rights, climate change, the Supreme Court vacancy and prescription drug prices. “Bottom-up Open Debates unite people across the political spectrum because they are not about right versus left, but new versus old,” said Lilia Tamm, the Open Debate Coalition’s program director. “With modern technology, we can utilize the wisdom of the crowds at FloridaOpenDebate.com to bypass silly questions, gotcha questions, and questions about the news of the week — and focus on issues voters care about most. We are thrilled to have members of Congress, moderators, and co-hosts from across the political spectrum for this historic Open Debate.”Mike McCurry, the co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said his organization was keeping an eye on the Open Debate to better understand how the Internet can be used to get “real questions from real people.”“This is a real opportunity to shape the future of presidential debates, not only in the primaries, but the general election as well,” McCurry said. Grayson faces Rep. Patrick Murphy in the August Democratic primary for his party’s nomination for the seat. Murphy declined to participate in the debate. On the Republican side, Jolly is hoping to stand out in a field that also includes Rep. Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, developer Carlos Beruff and businessman Todd Wilcox. Jolly’s GOP rivals didn’t qualify for the debate, which requires participants to have at least 15 percent support in polls.Share this slide:"
Hillary Clinton And Bernie Sanders Disagree On Taxing Soda,68,"There’s a new policy disagreement brewing between Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Hillary Clinton: a soda tax. Clinton said on Wednesday that she supports Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney’s proposal use pay for universal preschool using a soda tax.“It starts early with working with families, working with kids, building up community resources — I’m very supportive of the mayor’s proposal to tax soda to get universal preschool for kids,” she said at an event in the city, according to CNN. “I mean, we need universal preschool. And if that’s a way to do it, that’s how we should do it.”The Democratic mayor has suggested levying 3 cents in tax on every ounce of soda sold, according to The New York Times. It’s not clear whether consumers or distributors would have to pay the tax, the city anticipates it would drive up the cost of soda.Sanders responded to Clinton on Thursday by saying this plan would effectively tax low-income people, who tend to drink more soda than the wealthy.“Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000,” Sanders aid. “This proposal clearly violates her pledge. A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia.”Kenney accused Sanders of siding with big businesses.“I’m disappointed Sen. Sanders would ignore the interests of thousands of low-income — predominately minority children — and side with greedy beverage corporations who have spent millions in advertising for decades to target low income minority communities,” he said on Friday, according to philly.com.According to HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polling data, Clinton leads Sanders ahead of Pennsylvania’s Democratic primary on Tuesday.Share this slide:"
Snapchat Wants To Make ‘Ballot Selfies’ Legal On Election Day,30,"There’s a good chance that if you take out your phone to snap a photo of yourself voting on Election Day, an election official will tell you to knock it off. That’s because in many states, it’s still illegal to share a picture of your ballot. Social media giant Snapchat is now joining the fight to change the laws and give voters a right to the ballot selfie.A federal judge struck down New Hampshire’s ban on ballot photos last year, and the state is appealing that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit. Under the law, voters faced a $1,000 fine for sharing a picture of their ballot. On Friday, Snapchat filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing that the state’s ban violates the First Amendment. From its brief:A ballot selfie — like a campaign button — is a way to express support for or against a cause or a candidate. And because it is tangible proof of how a voter has voted, a ballot selfie is a uniquely powerful form of political expression. It proves that the voter’s stated political convictions are not just idle talk. Not only that, but ballot selfies and other digital expressions of civic engagement encourage others to vote — particularly younger voters who have historically low turnout rates. Ballot selfies are thus all at once deeply personal and virtuously public expressions.And they’re the sort of expressions that the State cannot categorically ban without violating the First Amendment.Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general of the United States, is one of the authors of Snapchat’s brief.Election law has not kept up with the ubiquity of smartphones. State officials are often left interpreting outdated statutes and creating policies that are unevenly applied and confusing for ordinary voters to figure out. They vary not only from state to state, but also from precinct to precinct.Most of the restrictions that do exist were put in place with the best of intentions, meant to preserve the integrity of the voting process. Preventing the photographing of ballots, officials argue, maintains ballot secrecy and discourages vote-buying schemes, in which a person takes a photo of a marked ballot to prove he or she chose the right candidate in order to receive a payout. But supporters of ballot selfies say these concerns do not outweigh First Amendment rights.There’s also the matter of uncovering electoral malfeasance. Reporters are often — but not always — granted special permission to record and photograph at polling locations, but citizen journalists generally are not. Snapchat argues that by restricting ballot photos, the state is hindering the public’s ability to report on and share information about problems at the polls:[B]allot selfies help the media perform its watchdog role in elections. Ballot-design problems — whether butterfly ballots, hanging chads, or some electronic glitch with computer screens — have all too frequently disrupted the orderly democratic process. A ballot-selfie ban like the State’s could deprive the public from learning about those problems or validating what might otherwise be dismissed as just unfounded anecdote. Snapchat has increased its political coverage in the 2016 campaign cycle, including creating stories about people voting that are made up of users’ individual Snapchats. In the New York primary, for instance, there were plenty of shots of people showing off their completed ballots because in that state, ballot photography is allowed.Below is The Huffington Post’s list of rules for ballot photography for each state.  Enter your email address:Share this slide:"
The Clinton Campaign Will Fight You On Twitter,1294,"Over the course of the Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Clinton’s principal argument against Bernie Sanders has been that his agenda — universal health care, free college tuition, et al. — is impractical, too utopian, too “pie in the sky.” This is especially true, she says, given the structural obstacles in the way. Sanders is promising to do the impossible; she, on the other hand, is the candidate who can Get Things Done.In other news, the Clinton campaign is planning to spend a lot of money in an effort to finally “correct” the internet. OK, then!As The Daily Beast’s Ben Collins reports, Correct The Record — the pro-Clinton PAC run by Media Matters founder David Brock — is “pledging to spend $1 million to ‘push back against’ users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram.”In a press release, Correct The Record outlined its strategy to use time and money in an incredibly savvy and not-at-all-bewildering way:Correct The Record will invest more than $1 million into Barrier Breakers 2016 activities, including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram[...]Lessons learned from online engagement with “Bernie Bros” during the Democratic Primary will be applied to the rest of the primary season and general election — responding quickly and forcefully to negative attacks and false narratives. Additionally, as the general election approaches, the task force will begin to push out information to Sanders supporters online, encouraging them to support Hillary Clinton.It has been said about many of Sanders’ initiatives that the money doesn’t add up. The Clinton campaign, though, will spend donor cash to “push back” on your Instagram feed, an airtight model of sensible and sustainable campaign spending that ?absolutely? constitutes the best use of a million dollars.It is reasonable to attribute this to “the Clinton campaign,” by the way. As Sunlight Foundation campaign-finance sorceress extraordinaire Libby Watson explains to Collins, loopholes in Federal Election Commission regulations allow Correct The Record to “openly coordinate with Clinton’s campaign, despite rules that typically disallow political campaigns from working directly with PACs.” (Although to be honest, we would have attributed any activity of Clinton-affiliated PACs and super PACs to the Clinton campaign, because Eat The Press’ official editorial position is that candidates are always coordinating with these entities.)This initiative will also attempt to combat online harassment, a genuinely noble goal that more social media platforms should undertake on their users’ behalf. The goal gets a little less noble, however, when your working definition of “harassment” is simply being at variance from a specific politician’s electoral endeavors.Still, have you ever tried to win an argument on social media? If so, you probably know that enacting a Canadian-style single-payer universal health care plan is a thing that is a million times easier to do. Hell, it would be easier for me to tame a wild Pegasus this afternoon and fly him to the Costa Brava for the weekend.But hey — if you want to personally hear from the Clinton campaign, just send a few uncivil tweets about superdelegates or Goldman Sachs speech transcripts or something. I’m guessing that calls are answered in the order they are received.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
"Unpopularity Of Clinton, Trump Puts Spotlight On Potential Running Mates",177,"Rarely have two U.S. presidential front-runners needed more from running mates than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.The Democratic and Republican leaders in the 2016 White House race are unusually unpopular nationally, polls show, despite their success with voters in their respective parties. Clinton has struggled to generate excitement about her candidacy and assuage voter concerns about her trustworthiness, while Trump fares badly among women and minorities in polls.Their weaknesses only increase the importance of their vice presidential pick, who could potentially help them rally support in key demographics ahead of the Nov. 8 vote - if each gets their party’s nomination.Hispanic advocacy groups are lobbying Clinton to choose a Hispanic running mate. The person most often mentioned - Julian Castro, the housing and urban development secretary who is one of the party’s rising stars - is opposed by liberal activists who accuse him of favoring Wall Street firms in the sale of distressed mortgages.Some of the groups have started an online petition against Castro’s candidacy, which has angered the Latino Victory Fund, a nonpartisan advocacy group that has been pushing for a Latino vice-presidential nominee.“These attacks against Secretary Castro are completely unfounded, short sighted, and only serve to pit us against each other,” said Cristobal Alex, the fund’s president. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce has called on Clinton to choose Castro.Democratic strategist Joe Velasquez, a Clinton supporter, said a Hispanic running mate could make a difference in swing states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia, which have large Hispanic populations. Polls show Hispanic voters overwhelmingly dislike Trump, in part because of his comments likening illegal immigrants to criminals.U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez has also been mentioned as a possible Latino pick.But Clinton’s decision isn’t clear-cut.Given Trump’s unpopularity with some moderate Republicans, she may want a vice-president who can wrest away some of those voters. Someone like Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia who personally opposes abortion, or New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who has close ties to the financial sector.There was no immediate comment from Castro, Kaine, Perez or Booker.Clinton though could give a higher priority to winning over liberal democrats, who see her as too pro-Wall Street and have flocked to her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Sherrod Brown, a senator from Ohio who is a fierce opponent of global trade deals, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of the banking industry, have both been named as possible vice president picks.Brown and Warren did not respond to requests for comment.Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis is skeptical that Clinton needs to spend much time appeasing the liberal wing of her party if she wins the nomination.“As much as people have made out this race between Clinton and Sanders to be an ideological death match, Donald Trump will do more to bring the Democratic Party together than anyone has ever done,” he said.Trump is viewed unfavorably by 80 percent of Democrats, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.But other Democrats fear the increasingly bitter Clinton-Sanders battle, has fractured the party. Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said Clinton’s pick “has to be viewed through a prism of, among other things, their ability to bring on Sanders voters.”SLIM PICKINGS?Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns refused to comment on the vice-presidential speculation, saying they remain focused on winning their respective nominating contests.Clinton holds a commanding lead among the party delegates who will pick the party’s nominee, but Sanders has pledged to keep fighting. Trump may not have the Republican nomination locked down until the summer, if he can beat off challenges by Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is running a distant third in the Republican race.Typically, vice-presidential selections are vetted for weeks after a candidate has emerged as the party’s nominee and are announced shortly before the party conventions in the summer.Trump’s polarizing candidacy could make his job of finding a running mate more difficult. For much of the campaign season, many in the Republican establishment, along with well-funded political committees, have been looking for ways to keep Trump from winning the Republican nomination.Trump has stated his preference for an established office-holder rather than a political neophyte like himself, specifically listing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and Kasich.Walker, who has endorsed Cruz, laughed when he was asked about the prospect, but has been noncommittal. Rubio has repeatedly rejected the idea. Kasich last week said there was “zero chance” of his playing second fiddle to Trump, despite mounting speculation that he would be an ideal candidate because of his deep government experience and Ohio’s crucial role as a general election swing state.A source close to Kasich told Reuters the governor has no interest in working with Trump as the two don’t agree on much.Cruz, too, said this week he would not be Trump’s running mate, while telling reporters in Hollywood, Florida on Wednesday that “a Trump-Kasich ticket loses to Hillary Clinton.”Tony Fratto, a Republican strategist, said Trump may be forced to turn to “guys at the end of their careers, not people who believe they have a future. Someone in their last act who has nothing to lose by accepting an offer from Trump.”That might include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has been one or the few establishment politicians to campaign for Trump, or Florida Governor Rick Scott, who has endorsed Trump. Both are in their final terms in office.Christie was asked about the prospect in an interview with a New Jersey radio station on Thursday.“The way I think about these things, you never say ‘never,’” he said.Other names linked to Trump include former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump adviser, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate.There was no immediate comment from Sessions, Scott and Giuliani. Armstrong Williams, a close adviser to Carson, said the former White House hopeful doesn’t want the slot.“At this point he has no interest in being in politics ... none,” Williams said. “I think Trump is looking for someone with government experience, someone who is more political.”(Reporting by James Oliphant, John Whitesides, Amanda Becker, Emily Flitter, Ginger Gibson, Steve Holland, Luciana Lopez, and Alana Wise.

HUFFPOLLSTER: Ted Cruz Is Now An Establishment Candidate To Most GOP Voters,262,"Republicans no longer think of Ted Cruz as an outsider. Latinos are eager to take to the polls to vote against Donald Trump in 2016. And Trump supporters don’t think Harriet Tubman should be on the the $20 bill. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 22, 2016. GOP VOTERS NOW THINK OF TED CRUZ AS ESTABLISHMENT - HuffPollster: “Here’s the latest proof of how strange this primary cycle has become: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who’s long tried to leverage his colleagues’ loathing into a version of outsider cred, is overwhelmingly viewed by his party as an establishment candidate. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 62 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say that Cruz is more of an establishment candidate, while just 29 percent describe him as an outsider. That’s a marked shift since December, when just 36 percent considered him part of the establishment….While that might help Cruz make his case on the floor of a contested convention, it’s unlikely to endear him to his party — 62 percent say they’d prefer a political outsider. In contrast, just 26 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say the same.“ [HuffPost] LATINOS MOTIVATED BY TRUMP TO VOTE: Esther Yu-Hsi Lee: “[T]here’s evidence that Latino voters may be ‘enthusiastic’ to hit the polls in November to defeat Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Latino agenda. A national poll released Thursday by [the pro-immigration reform]  America’s Voice and Latino Decisions found that 79 percent of voters had a ‘very unfavorable’ opinion of Trump….In an open-ended question about why voters were enthusiastic to vote this year, the poll found that 41 percent wanted to fight ‘against/stop Trump/fight back anti-immigrant/Latino.’ Only three percent noted that they were enthusiastic because they were hoping to be ‘against/stop Cruz…’ As Trump continues to infuse more anti-immigrant and anti-Latino rhetoric into his speeches, it seems likely he’ll continue to bleed support from Latino voters.” [ThinkProgress]TRUMP SUPPORTERS DISAPPROVE OF HARRIET TUBMAN ON THE $20 BILL - Kayte Korwitts: “Yesterday, historic news hit: a woman will finally appear on the face of American currency...Over half (56%) believe this is the right move….Presidential hopefuls have their own opinions on the matter as well. Donald Trump has expressed his disapproval. His supporters have Trump’s back here with 7 in 10 agreeing that this wasn’t a great idea. On the Democratic side, it’s nearly an even split with 81% of Clinton supporters and 85% of Sanders supporters agreeing to agree with one another….Perhaps surprisingly, slightly more credit users prefer Tubman on the bill than those who pay with cash (60% vs 54%).” [SurveyMonkey]‘WALMART MOMS’ FOCUS GROUPS SHOW DISTRUST OF PRIMARY SYSTEM - Margaret Chadbourn: “Any attempt to deny Donald Trump the Republican Party’s nomination if he wins the most votes would be wrong and corrupt, a focus group of GOP voters in Pennsylvania said Wednesday night as the state’s primary approaches. Trump has complained about the primary system for weeks, calling it ‘rigged,’ a message that appears to resonate with these Keystone State voters….Two focus groups organized by the GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and Purple Strategies were questioned Wednesday evening...One group was made up of Republican voters from the Pittsburgh area and the second was comprised of undecided voters from the Philadelphia suburbs….The pollsters who conducted the sessions said the participants were clearly concerned about the idea that a candidate who secures the most votes in the primary could lose the nomination after falling short of the number needed to win outright, which they said contributes to their cynical attitude about the 2016 campaign.” [ABC]AMERICANS WANT TO LEAD ON GLOBAL HEALTH BUT DON’T THINK MONEY IS THE SOLUTION - Liz Hamel, Ashley Kirzinger, and Mollyann Brodie “The latest survey finds that a majority of the public wants the U.S. to take either the leading role or a major role in trying to solve international problems generally, as well as in improving health for people in developing countries specifically....Seven in ten Americans believe that the current level of U.S. spending on health in developing countries is too little or about right, yet the public is somewhat skeptical about the ability of more spending to lead to progress, with more than half saying that spending more money will not lead to meaningful progress. Another notable trend is the decreasing visibility of U.S. efforts to improve health in developing countries; just over a third of the public says they have heard ‘a lot’ or ‘some’ about these efforts in the past 12 months, a decrease of 21 percentage points since 2010.” [Kaiser Family Foundation]  HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Ted Cruz Says He Lacks Sleep,859,"Republican presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lamented his lack of sleep on the campaign trail, listing it among the many “sacrifices for our campaign.” “Health and sleep are limited: Fighting morning and night for the future of our country ensures long nights and early mornings resulting in little to no sleep,” Cruz said this week in his latest fundraising email. He told supporters he’s “proud to be making” such sacrifices “on your behalf.”Sleep deprivation appears part of the presidential campaign, as the candidates crisscross the country with speeches, town halls, meet-and-greets, rallies, meetings and fundraisers.But unfortunately for Cruz and his rivals for the presidency, there is a clear link between executive leadership and getting enough sleep. A study this year by consulting firm McKinsey and Harvard Business Review found that more than 40 percent of business leaders reported they don’t get enough sleep at least four nights a week.The researchers noted that sleep deprivation limited executives’ ability to think of creative solutions to problems, consider other people’s viewpoints, focus on results and support other people. It also led to leaders who were less engaged and more burned out.Cruz’s listing of sacrifices raised the ire of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who posted a lengthy rant on Twitter saying that many of the same sacrifices Cruz voluntarily makes for his campaign are a daily reality for working families. She attacked him for blocking policies that would ease problems for working families, like paid family leave and raising the minimum wage.Share this slide:"
"Ted Cruz Is Now An Establishment Candidate, According To GOP Voters",132,"Here’s the latest proof of how strange this primary cycle has become: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who’s long tried to leverage his colleagues’ loathing into a version of outsider cred, is overwhelmingly viewed by his party as an establishment candidate.  In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 62 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say that Cruz is more of an establishment candidate, while just 29 percent describe him as an outsider. That’s a marked shift since December, when just 36 percent considered him part of the establishment.Voters aren’t exactly wrong in their assessment of the race. With the original slate of establishment-favored candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) out of the campaign, elected officials have tepidly rallied around Cruz. As FiveThirtyEight’s endorsement tracker shows, he currently leads his Republican rivals in endorsements, even as he trails far behind the support racked up by nominees in past campaigns.While that might help Cruz make his case on the floor of a contested convention, it’s unlikely to endear him to his party — 62 percent say they’d prefer a political outsider. In contrast, just 26 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say the same.GOP voters’ increasing impression that Cruz is part of the establishment has coincided with a modest decline in their opinion of him, although it’s hard to say which of those views is driving the other. The most recent Economist/YouGov survey gives him a 56 percent favorability rating among Republicans, down from 67 percent in January.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted April 14-15 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

GOP Lawmakers Are Already Planning To Bail On Their Own Convention,1465,"WASHINGTON — Several Republican lawmakers up for re-election this year are planning to avoid the chaos of their party’s presidential convention and stay home. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, said he was skipping the Cleveland event in order to campaign in November.“I have to campaign for re-election, and I have always done that when I’m up,” McCain told reporters this week.McCain attended and spoke at the GOP convention in New York City in 2004, however, when he was similarly up for re-election. He also spoke at the party’s 2012 convention in Tampa.Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), who’s been getting clobbered by Democrats for his role in blocking President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, said he’s only going to the convention if he can find a cheap place to stay.“I will do something different and maybe stay in hotels or motels I can buy a night at a time,” he said on a Wednesday conference call.New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte said in a CNN interview last week that it was “unlikely” she would attend the convention, adding she would be “focusing on my voters in New Hampshire.” North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr said he would be “more valuable outside of Cleveland than inside of Cleveland.” Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, perhaps the most endangered Senate Republican, is also staying home. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said he is planning on attending “but things could change.”Sen. Dan Coats (Ind.), who is retiring at the end of the year, said his colleagues are safer staying away from the “potentially toxic” event.“You’re better off being in your own state, running your own race and not being caught up in all the machinations that may take place at the convention,” he said.“This one is potentially toxic,” he added. “You don’t see too many candidates endorsing anybody for that very reason. You endorse Trump and the Cruz people are mad, you endorse Cruz and the Trump people are mad.”The situation is perhaps most awkward for Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), who represents the state where the convention is being held. Portman, who is facing a tough re-election fight, told USA Today that he would keep a low profile at the convention and spend “very little” time there. “Like, very little,” he stressed. Rather than being associated with a potential horror show, Portman will instead hold his own “mini-convention” at a community college that will feature “high-profile speakers” and training sessions for volunteers. As if to make amends even further, the senator will spend part of the convention week “building a Habitat for Humanity house in Cleveland.”Sen. Dean Heller (Nev.) said he may skip the convention “over concerns of his own safety.” “Things could get pretty testy,” he said. “Frankly my biggest concern is security, whether or not I feel it is safe enough to attend a convention.” Indeed, there may be ample reason for concern. The GOP front-runner has repeatedly suggested that “riots” would take place in Cleveland if he is denied the nomination. Over the weekend, Donald Trump again warned the Republican National Committee it could face a “rough July” if it doesn’t treat him fairly. The city of Cleveland is preparing for such a scenario, purchasing riot gear and plastic ties used for arrests. But even some former GOP presidential candidates have decided to pass on Cleveland. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who delivered a speech during the 2012 convention in Tampa, gave CNN a flat “No” when asked if he would be attending. Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) may also skip the event, according to The Washington Post.There are signs of trouble in the festivities leading up to the convention as well. Joe Walsh, guitarist for the rock group The Eagles, on Thursday canceled an appearance at a concert he initially believed was a non-partisan event for veterans when he discovered it was actually a kick-off event for the GOP convention.Walsh said in a statement that he is “very concerned about the rampant vitriol, fear-mongering and bullying coming from the current Republican campaigns,” adding that he “cannot in good conscience endorse the Republican party in any way.”Businesses like Microsoft and AT&T, as well as big-time party donors who usually help fund the festivities at conventions, are also feeling the heat, The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month. On Thursday, advocacy organization Latino Victory Fund launched a campaign calling on Microsoft to “take a stand for Latinos” and cancel its sponsorship of the convention due to the “the hate, bigotry and ignorance that has fueled Trump’s campaign.”Correction: This article erroneously described Joe Walsh as a keyboardist. He is lead guitarist.Share this slide:"
Donald Trump Thinks North Carolina Got It Wrong On Anti-LGBT Bathroom Bill,4608,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday that transgender people should be allowed to use whichever bathroom they prefer.During a town hall on NBC, Trump said North Carolina’s anti-LGBT bathroom measure, which has hurt the state economically, wasn’t necessary and sought to address a problem that wasn’t really a big issue. The bill also prohibits local municipalities from passing additional measures to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination.“North Carolina did something that was very strong and they’re paying a big price. There’s a lot of problems,” Trump said. “You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom they feel is appropriate, there has been so little trouble, and the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife, and the economic punishment that they’re taking.”Advocates of the North Carolina law, which only allows people to use the restroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate, say it is necessary to protect the privacy of children. As Trump pointed out, the suggestion that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom they want will jeopardize the safety of other people is a myth. Trump’s position is a clear break from his rival for the Republican nomination, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), who has called the North Carolina bill a “perfectly reasonable determination for the people to make.”“Men should not be going to the bathroom with little girls,” he said in an MSNBC town hall earlier this month.Cruz repeated that position in response to Trump on Thursday and accused him of bending to political correctness.“Donald Trump is no different from politically correct leftist elites. Today, he joined them in calling for grown men to be allowed to use little girls’ public restrooms,” Cruz said in a statement. “As the dad of young daughters, I dread what this will mean for our daughters - and for our sisters and our wives. It is a reckless policy that will endanger our loved ones.”Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is also seeking the Republican nomination, has said he would not have signed the North Carolina law.Trump added that he isn’t sure if he had transgender people working for him in the Trump organization but “probably did.” He also said he would feel comfortable letting Caitlyn Jenner, who came out as transgender last year, use whichever bathroom she felt comfortable choosing in Trump Tower.?This story has been updated to include Cruz’s statement.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Here’s A Look At The 2016 Race By The Numbers,125,"It’s official: The 2016 presidential election is already a 10-figure affair.Household names such as Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz account for much of this spending. But a gaggle of obscure and moneyed super PACs have likewise helped rocket campaign expenditures to mesospheric levels — ones unthinkable even four years ago.Here’s a rundown of the more telling — and curious — statistics to emerge from a new round of political campaign disclosures:$1 billion: Amount spent by presidential candidates and affiliated groups in the 2016 presidential race through March, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of federal campaign finance filings. Nearly two-thirds of this figure has been spent in the contentious GOP primary, which saw more than a dozen candidates vie for the party’s nomination. The top-spending Republican? Cruz, who has spent more than $70 million. Meanwhile, Democrats Clinton and Sanders have combined to spend about $326 million, with each spending about half that sum.$118 million: Amount Sanders raised, through March 31, from small-dollar donors giving $200 or less. That sum represents nearly two-thirds of his overall haul. Sanders’ unexpected fundraising prowess — he’s raised about$186 million, just $870,000 less than Clinton — has helped him stay competitive in the presidential primary. Small-dollar donors giving $200 or less only account for about 20 percent of Clinton’s receipts through March. She’s relied far more heavily on donors giving the legal maximum of $2,700. However, Clinton has a much wider lead in the delegate race than the fundraising race. She’s won about 25 percent more pledged delegates to date than Sanders and needs only about 450 more delegates to secure the nomination, according to the Associated Press.$36.2 million: Amount Republican front-runner Trump has either donated or loaned to his presidential campaign from his own funds. A billionaire real estate tycoon and reality TV star, Trump has said he would spend up to $1 billion to win the White House “if necessary.” All the while, he’s also raised more than $12 million from people not named Trump. About three-fourths of that sum has come from small-dollar donors giving $200 or less.$2.1 million: Amount Qualcomm Inc. executive Mark Epstein has donated toMaryland USA, the super PAC supporting his wife Amie Hoeber’s congressional bid. Hoeber, a Republican running in Maryland’s 6th Congressional District, has raised $480,000 for her race, including $350,000 that she’s loaned her campaign. Epstein’s contributions represent 99.95 percent of the money Maryland USA has raised.$2 million: Amount spent by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson’s campaign in March, even though Carson ended his presidential bid on March 4. It’s far less than the campaign spent in previous months, but some top campaign consultants (including Eleventy Marketing and Precision Data Management) still took in six-figure payments.$1,055,100: What Democrat Willie Wilson is owed by his own presidential campaign, for which he filed termination paperwork Wednesday. Willie who, you say? Wilson is a Chicago businessman and gospel music show host who last year launched the longest of longshot presidential bids. His self-funded campaign didn’t go so well, as Williams failed to qualify for most primary and caucus contests. He did get on the South Carolina primary ballot, winning0.35 percent of the Democratic vote.$1 million: What oil giant Chevron Corp.donated in March to a super PAC called the Congressional Leadership Fund, whichsupports Republican candidates. Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the United States, is currently ranked as No. 3 on the Fortune 500 list, making it the largest known corporate super PAC donor. It’s rare for large, publicly traded companies to donate to super PACs, but Chevron has now donated $4.5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund since 2012, plus an additional $1 million to the Senate Leadership Fund last year.$402,000: Amount former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential campaignreported making from the sale of his donor information following Bush’sFebruary withdrawal from the presidential race. The buyer: direct response marketing firm the Lukens Company.$131,679: How much the Trump campaign spent on hats during March with headwear manufacturer Cali Fame. A single red cap dubbed “5 Panel Patriot” retails for $15.50 on Cali Fame’s website. The seemingly same hat, with Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan embroidered on its front panel,sells for $25 on Trump’s website.$100,000: Amount super PAC Freedom Partners Action Fund contributed toAccelerate West Virginia, a super PAC created to boost the gubernatorial bid of Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. The contribution is Accelerate West Virginia’s largest received so far. Freedom Partners Action Fund is one of a network of groups linked to billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Accelerate West Virginia describes itself as “a group of local West Virginians dedicated to moving our state forward.”$72,290: Money Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s defunct presidential campaign owes Jones Day, a Washington, D.C., law firm, for “legal consulting.” It’s part of $952,256 in debt still on the Walker campaign’s books. Curiously, Jones Day employs former Federal Election Commission Chairman Don McGahn, who now serves as Trump’s general counsel. Walker last monthendorsed Trump rival Cruz.$72,000: Amount the Democratic National Committee paid pro-Clinton super PACAmerican Bridge 21st Century in March for “research services.” American Bridge 21st Century, which specializes in opposition research, raised about $3.1 million during the first three months of 2016, with major donors including billionaires George Soros and Phillip “Terry” Ragon. The super PAC has also collected $210,000 from its sister 501(c)(4) nonprofit — known as the American Bridge 21st Century Foundation, which doesn’t disclose its donors — in the form of “overhead and staff expenses.”$50,000: Amount Laura Ricketts, a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, donated in February to LPAC, a hybrid super PAC she helped launched in 2012 that seeksto “builds the political power of lesbians and queer women by electing candidates who champion LGBTQ rights, women’s equality and social justice.” Ricketts’ contribution accounted for about 20 percent of the LPAC’s receipts this year through March. The group has endorsed Clinton in the 2016 presidential race and also directly donated to Democratic U.S. Senate candidates Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Donna Edwards of Maryland.$44,000: Cash super PAC Pursuing America’s Greatness spent on legal and compliance costs in March. The group, which supported former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination, isengaged in a lawsuit challenging FEC regulations that prohibit the use of a candidate’s name by unauthorized committees such as super PACs.7,194: Orders of hand-breaded onion ring towers one could buy for $50,000 at the Hard Rock Rocksino, an entertainment facility in suburban Cleveland featuring horse racing, casino gaming and eponymous chain restaurant fare. Fifty grand is also what the Hard Rock Rocksino contributed last month to New Day for America, a super PAC supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s long-shot presidential bid.

Cory Gardner with on March 31. The contribution isn’t itself particularly odd. But Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, isn’t running for re-election in 2016. Or in 2018. He’ll likely face his next political contest in June 2020 — 50 months from now — when Colorado conducts a congressional primary ahead of elections for the 117th Congress.

If anyone needs cash, it’s Gingrich: As of March 31, his 2012 presidential campaign remained more than $4.6 millionin debt, with more than 100 vendors among Newt 2012’s creditors — including Twitter, Comcast and a consulting company led by fellow 2012 presidential also-ran Herman Cain.1: The number of things on which “Donald and Ted” say they stand together, according to a fundraising email from Stop Hillary PAC. That thing? Stopping Clinton from becoming president. How did Stop Hillary PAC, a scrappy conservative outfit perhaps best known for defying FEC orders to change its name, ever get Trump and Cruz to join forces? Simple: it didn’t. “Donald” is Donald Ferguson, the PAC’s political director, and “Ted” is Ted Harvey, its chairman. Might sending fundraising messages from a Ted and Donald — sans last names — cause potential donors to be misled, even a teeny, tiny bit? “Not to my knowledge, and that’s pretty far-fetched,” treasurer Dan Backer told the Center for Public Integrity, noting that both men have been signing Stop Hillary PAC missives since 2013. The PAC raised more than $130,000 during the first three months of 2016, mostly from small-dollar donors.Alexander Cohen and Chris Zubak-Skees contributed to this report.This story is from the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C. Read more of its investigations on the influence of money in politics or follow it on Twitter.Share this slide:"
Donald Trump Isn’t Happy That Harriet Tubman Is Replacing Andrew Jackson On The $20,6738,"Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump says it’s “pure political correctness” to replace former President Andrew Jackson with abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, as the U.S. Treasury Department plans to do in coming years.The Manhattan real estate mogul defended Jackson, one of the nation’s earliest populists who is known for carrying out a bloody “Indian removal” policy as president.“Andrew Jackson had a great history. I think it’s very rough when you take someone off the bill,” Trump said in an interview on NBC’s “Today.” “I think Harriet Tubman is fantastic, I would love to leave Andrew Jackson.”The GOP front-runner echoed the remarks of Ben Carson, who endorsed Trump after dropping out of the presidential race earlier this year, by suggesting Tubman appear on “another denomination” such as the $2 bill.“Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt,” Carson said in an interview Wednesday. “In honor of that, we kick him off of the money.”“I love Harriet Tubman, I love what she did,” Carson continued. “But we can find another way to honor her. Maybe a $2 bill.”The $2 bill, however, features Thomas Jefferson and is in much lower circulation than the widely used $20 bill.While Tubman is not likely to assume her place on the $20 for some time, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Wednesday that Jackson would appear on the back of the bill — perhaps in an image of his statue in Lafayette square near the White House.Back in September, all GOP presidential candidates were asked during a debate which woman they would like to see on the $10 bill — whose fate was being debated at the time.Trump said he did not mind replacing Alexander Hamilton, but offered similar objections over political correctness. He said he’d put his daughter, Ivanka, on the bill or civil rights hero Rosa Parks.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
"An All-Female Ticket? ‘No Question’ It Could Happen, Clinton’s Campaign Says",4080,"If Hillary Clinton scores the Democratic nomination for president, she’d be shattering a major glass ceiling. But her campaign indicated that she could make history again by choosing a woman as her running mate.“We’ll start with a broad list [of potential vice presidential candidates] and then begin to narrow it,” Clinton 2016 chairman John Podesta told The Boston Globe. “But there is no question that there will be women on that list.”Clinton had previously indicated that they wouldn’t rule out a female veep, but this is the campaign’s strongest stance on the matter so far.The Globe floated Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had been rumored to be considering a presidential bid herself. Other women whose names have been floated are Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)Conventional wisdom suggests that she could also pick someone who is vastly different from her — young, male, and a person of color. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or Julian Castro, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, would fit the bill in that case.Share this slide:Actions curated in support of equality and sustainability everywhere.

John Kasich Is Bringing America A Dose Of Dr. Phil On The Campaign Trail,258,"SCHENECTADY, N.Y. — The man who asked the first question of the evening at John Kasich’s town hall meeting here on Monday was wearing sunglasses, and the candidate just couldn’t resist.“I wear my sunglasses at night!” Kasich said, as a staffer handed the man a microphone.The Ohio governor waited for the laughter in the audience to die down.“No, that’s just a song,” he added. Kasich likes to punctuate campaign events with his characteristic brand of oddball levity. It’s a good way to break up his heavy monologues about life and loss, as well as the frequent bouts of wisdom-dispensing that define his interactions with voters. “You have to find out what your gifts are, and then you have to use them to heal the world,” he instructed the man moments after poking fun at his sunglasses. If your current perception of the race for the Republican presidential nomination consists solely of the nasty and combustible standoff between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, you’ve been missing a weird and wonderful component in the form of Kasich. The sense that his run for the White House amounts to little more than an endearing sideshow is, however, often bolstered by his events. The acoustics inside the Schenectady Armory, for instance, weren’t great. They were terrible, in fact, as a dull echo made it difficult to hear what the candidate was saying. The crowd of a few hundred people who turned out to see Kasich the day before he finished second in the New York GOP primary might have been impressive by the standards of a town hall meeting in New Hampshire last August. But just a day after Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said he drew nearly 30,000 people to a rally in Brooklyn, Kasich’s gathering felt less like a rock concert and more like a retreat for likeminded souls, featuring the candidate as motivational speaker and life coach extraordinaire.Kasich’s unique version of everyman shtick typically begins with his own rags-to-riches story of growing up the son of a mailman and the grandson of a coal miner who died of black lung disease. But more than any other candidate remaining in the race, Kasich thrives on the give-and-take with voters. It was only five or six minutes into his abbreviated stump speech in Schenectady that he took the first question from the man who wears his sunglasses at night.“What can you do as president to help inspire the people to live a good life, so they can all be successful?” the man asked.Kasich began his answer to that open-ended question with an even more open-ended question of his own. “Who do you think that depends on?” he asked. “Does that depend on a president?”Then, after a little more back-and-forth, the candidate tied it all in with the feel-good mantra that has been his unlikely ticket to mild success in a GOP race in which the loudest, angriest voices have otherwise prevailed.“I believe that everyone is made special, OK? Everybody,” he said. “I don’t know if you believe this or know this, but there’s never been anybody like you before. And there will never be anyone like you again. You’re made special.” The “Barney & Friends” theme song, you may be surprised to hear, did not start playing from the public address speaker next. This is just the way Kasich talks to people on a regular basis. It’s a presidential campaign in which the candidate doles out self-improvement advice at least as often as he does policy prescriptions and lays his emotions bare wherever he goes, all the while holding out hope that he can win an unlikely, multi-ballot victory at the Republican National Convention in just three months.To say that pulling off the feat would be the equivalent of hitting an inside straight would be an understatement. But Kasich appears to be drinking in every moment of the experience of running for president. His style of campaigning is an emotional rollercoaster ride of public bear hugs, flashes of temper and — perhaps most prominently — lectures on faith, humanity, the mystery of life, and how to live it. John Weaver, Kasich’s top strategist, calls it “conservative reform with a dose of Dr. Phil.” “It’s certainly evolved that way, and people feel comfortable, for whatever reason, talking to him about their deepest secrets or most significant concerns about their personal lives or the country,” Weaver said. “And he has an incredible ability to connect with people and be empathetic and help nurture people at these events.” While human empathy has become the centerpiece of the long-shot candidate’s message, make no mistake that Kasich is still playing to win. This is a race that has defied predictions at every turn, and as they stare down the prospect of an open convention, Team Kasich sees no reason to give up now.Even as the #NeverTrump movement has tended to coalesce around the idea that Cruz represents the last best chance to keep Trump from winning the GOP nomination, Kasich’s supporters aren’t ready to throw in the towel either.When asked if she could envision herself eventually backing Cruz for the greater good of stopping Trump, Arlyn Shultis, a Kasich backer from nearby Ballston Spa, breathed out an aghast murmur that seemed intended to convey near-horror.“That’s game theory, as opposed to who you think is best,” said her husband, Kenton Shultis. “[The Republican Party] is a private organization, and it can pick candidates however it wants to. And if it wants to succeed, fine, and if it wants to fail, that’s not so smart.”The argument that he is the only Republican remaining in the race who can win in November has become the central aspect of Kasich’s case — and the one that his campaign is pushing forcefully, as it continues to seek out minimal opportunities to add to his modest delegate total.“The reasons I beat Hillary [Clinton] is because my appeal is broad and not narrow,” Kasich said during a relatively rare deviation from his discourse on topics such as self-worth and purpose at the Schenectady Armory. “My appeal is I can get blue-collar workers, and I can get independents.” Kasich will be in Hollywood, Florida, later this week as the Republican National Committee holds its annual spring meeting. He plans to hobnob there with convention delegates, in addition to making his case more thoroughly during a speech at a private reception for the RNC.His entire senior-level campaign team also plans to convene in south Florida to chew over his strategy, which relies on the far-from-certain assumptions that Trump will fail to win the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination on the first ballot and that Cruz won’t become the immediate de facto choice if the front-runner does fall short.The Kasich campaign’s hopes rest on the premise that a first-round defeat knocks out Trump entirely and then Kasich steadily gains delegates on the second and third ballots in what will become a two-person race against Cruz. And then — most likely on that third or fourth ballot, their thinking goes — sanity wins the day, and the delegates settle on the one man who has a realistic shot at winning the general election.In the meantime, the name of the game is picking up as many delegates as possible through June.To Trump’s chagrin, Cruz’s campaign has widely been credited for its ability to master the complex delegate selection process in various states. But there are recent signs that the Kasich campaign is holding its own in that regard, though within far more limited parameters. Kasich’s campaign boasts that it has secured the support of a majority of Indiana’s 57 delegates, in the event that the convention goes to a second ballot and they are relieved from their first-ballot obligations to the winner of the state’s primary. His team also believes that Kasich will do reasonably well in adding to his tally in the five Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states that vote next Tuesday.Still, the electability-in-November argument, rather than committed delegates, remains Team Kasich’s strategic lynchpin. “It’s demonstrably proven that John Kasich can win in a landslide and the other two would lose in a landslide, costing us at least one Supreme Court justice and probably the U.S. Senate, and that’s a compelling argument for people whose job is to put together a winning ticket,” Weaver said. “We have our own internal [delegate] count, and it’s significantly larger than what’s publicly discussed, and that’s because we’re picking up people who say that once they get past their legal obligation on the first ballot, they’re with us.”Even granting that assumption, however, Kasich faces long odds. He has won only his home state of Ohio thus far and will be hard-pressed to make the case why a candidate who has failed so often in the primaries and currently holds fewer delegates than Sen. Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the race over a month ago, should rightfully be handed the nomination in Cleveland.To keep his already dim hopes from burning out, the RNC would first have to revoke a rule, passed during the 2012 convention, that stipulates only candidates who have won the majority of delegates in at least eight states or territories can be nominated.And then there is the problem of lack of media attention. It’s a reality that reflects Kasich’s dearth of primary season victories and perpetuates the idea that he is not a real contender — a perception that could prove toxic to delegates’ thinking on second and third ballots.“Our campaign is not a movement, and we can’t get 20 or 30,000 people to a rally because we’re not famous and we don’t have a self-perpetuating energy clause,” said one senior-level Kasich adviser. “Most of the people who come out [for] those self-help sessions tend to come out because they actually want to hear John Kasich.”None of this seems to concern Kasich much, as he continues to campaign on a shoestring budget and his own terms, with only a small pack of embedded national network reporters documenting his moves and local news coverage often just as lacking.And if, as just about everyone expects, he doesn’t come out on top in the end, Kasich declares that he’ll be happy to return to what he often refers to as “the second best job in America” with his head held high.“If we live life bigger than ourselves, and we eventually come to what I think the Lord wants us to do, and if we happen to be gone five minutes from now, well, it’s gonna be like, you ran the race,” he said in Schenectady. “And a lot of it isn’t how you run the race, it’s how you finish the race.” This article was updated to reflect that Kasich finished second in New York’s GOP primary.You have to find out what your gifts are, and then you have to use them to heal the world.People feel comfortable, for whatever reason, talking to him about their deepest secrets or most significant concerns about their personal lives or the country.If we live life bigger than ourselves, and we eventually come to what I think the Lord wants us to do, and if we happen to be gone five minutes from now, well, it’s gonna be like, you ran the race."
Elizabeth Warren Calls Out Ted Cruz’s Hypocrisy In Epic Tweetstorm,23316,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) may not be on the presidential ballot this year, but that does not exactly mean she is sitting out the race.Warren has used her influential bully pulpit to devastating effect against business mogul Donald Trump. She schooled Senate Republicans intent on denying hearings for the president’s Supreme Court nominee, because it is a presidential election year.And her warm words for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) candidacy have kept pundits wondering whether she will ever endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.Now, Warren is training her fire on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The Massachusetts progressive seized on a Cruz campaign fundraising email in which Cruz touts the “sacrifices” he has made for his candidacy, including enduring personal attacks and severe reductions in family time and sleep.In a series of tweets, Warren lambasted Cruz for failing to support policies that would address the even greater stresses American families face due to economic circumstances not of their choosing. She cites Cruz’s opposition to providing paid family leave, affordable child care, increasing the minimum wage, and student debt relief, as well as his inflammatory remarks about minority groups, as examples of his hypocrisy.Read the full tweetstorm below:"
The Real New York Results Are Already In — And The Winner Is Nastiness,1158,"NEW YORK — Even before votes are counted in the primary here, the future of the 2016 race is clear: Big wins by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will not prevent ever more toxic levels of chaos and viciousness between now and November.Whatever comity there was between Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her rival for the Democratic nomination, has been shredded by a crossfire of personal attacks.Sanders’ newfound New York-style aggression — which some supporters have been waiting impatiently for him to unfurl — has brought him into a tie with Clinton in the national polls. And he will continue to be well-funded and far shrewder than the Clinton campaign in the use of social media.“We’re taking this all the way,” said Sanders’s top campaign adviser, Tad Devine. There was no doubt that he meant it — whatever the final tally of Tuesday’s state primary turns out to be.Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has proven a formidable foe in the ground-level delegate wars. Infuriated by this (and by Cruz’s taunting braggadocio about his evangelical minions), Trump, the truculent GOP front-runner, is all but threatening violence at the Republican convention.“I hope it doesn’t involve violence,” he said this week of July’s convention. But if he is denied the nomination, he said, the scene in Cleveland would be “rough.”And the formerly avuncular Sanders, brimming with his own resentment about The System, is using New York to amp up his rhetoric, in part to extract more online donations from loyalists.The race in both parties is at a pivotal moment, and New York — which rarely gets to play a role in nail-biter situations like this — has been the perfect place for the nasty to get even nastier.It’s the way things are here. In Minnesota, there really is such as thing as “Minnesota Nice.” Same for a state like Iowa.But there’s precious little “nice” in most of New York state. Outside the NYC environs, many people in cities like Buffalo and Rochester resent always having to play Pluto and Neptune to Manhattan’s blazing sun.And in a 2009 Travel + Leisure ranking of the 30 friendliest cities in American, New York City itself came in dead last.When Clinton and Sanders went at it in their Brooklyn debate last week, the audience sounded like the bloodthirsty crowd at a boxing match in Madison Square Garden.It was all too appropriate to the tenor of the 2016 campaign.Six months from now, no matter who the finalists are, the mood of the race will be New York aggression writ large: more about voting against the person you don’t like than voting for the one you do, more about candidates scaring their bases into turning out than gently wooing a vanished “middle.”The most recent poll numbers show why.Even as Clinton and Trump are expected to win their shared home state, they’ve grown less popular nationally after two weeks of campaigning in the mean streets.In New York, Clinton has been the major loser of national stature if not convention delegates, finding herself the object of increasingly accusatory and personal attacks from Sanders.According to an NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll, Clinton is now regarded negatively by 56 percent of the electorate, a jump of nearly 10 points from this time last year, by HuffPost Pollster figures. Clinton’s campaign officials have attributed the rising unfavorables to Sanders’ recent attacks on her character.Trump, meanwhile, is perhaps the most unpopular front-runner for a presidential nomination in modern history. Two-thirds of voters in the NBC/WSJ poll view him negatively. This would seem like a virtually insurmountable obstacle to his gaining the White House.The traditional consultants’ rule is that a “negative rating” of more than 40-45 percent makes a candidate unelectable. If that’s the case, then Cruz can’t win the White House either, since he is viewed unfavorably by 49 percent of voters.Sanders continues to be regarded favorably, and he is now running neck-and-neck with Clinton in several national polls. But that’s come at a cost to his own image, which has grown somewhat more negative with voters in general.Gone is starry-eyed Uncle Bernie, depicted by supporters as a friend to all living things and a humble servant of noble ideas, his odyssey set to the gentle strains of Simon & Garfunkel.In New York, that figure has vanished, replaced by someone who’s reared his head in both Vermont and Washington in the past: an acerbic and even arrogant politician, contemptuous of foes (and many putative friends) and adept at hiding his stiletto blade under a professorial cloak.Only Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) has maintained what might be called a truly winning profile, in that just 19 percent of the electorate reports having a negative view of him. But that may be because a great many people still have only the faintest idea who he is.If he wants to get better known in this campaign, he had better get nastier — certainly before Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, takes the GOP center stage next week.Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting."
Hillary Clinton Wins New York Primary,12473,"Hillary Clinton handily won New York’s Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, recapturing the state that twice elected her U.S. senator.“Today you proved once again, there’s no place like home,” Clinton said to loud cheers at her victory rally in Times Square, where she was joined by her husband and daughter. “In this campaign, we’ve won in every region of the country. ... But this one’s personal. New Yorkers, you’ve always had my back. And I’ve always tried to have yours.”Clinton’s victory adds to her delegate lead and damages Sanders’ claims that he can catch up to her. More importantly, it avoids what would have been an embarrassing loss that would have boosted her rival’s momentum. “The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sight,” she added Tuesday night. Clinton had long led in the polls, although Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Brooklyn native, refused to concede the state without a fight. The Clinton team recognized the symbolism of New York and knew what a loss would mean. She was campaigning in the state two weeks ago, even before Wisconsin’s voters had gone to the polls.Sanders attracted massive crowds across New York. More than 28,300 people turned out to see him in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park on Sunday, according to his campaign, which called it his biggest rally to date. The state has a natural core of supporters for him, with a significant number of strong progressives who turned law professor Zephyr Teachout’s 2014 primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) into a real race. But Sanders also stumbled when an interview with the New York Daily News editorial board raised questions about his knowledge of certain policy areas and resulted in some brutal coverage.During last week’s debate in Brooklyn, Sanders struggled to explain his vote to grant legal immunity to gun manufacturers, while Clinton continued to dodge calls to release transcripts of speeches she gave to Wall Street firms. Sanders also had to clarify comments that he didn’t think Clinton was qualified to be president, presenting the former secretary of state with an opportunity to tout her qualifications. Clinton waged an aggressive campaign to win New York, built upon connections developed during her eight years as the state’s junior senator. Backed by the governor, she sought to remind voters why they liked her and elected her then. “We have an advantage in New York because we had Hillary here as our senator. We know how good she is,” Cuomo told volunteers and other supporters at a phone-banking event in Buffalo on Monday. “We know what she brought back to New York and how she helped [the University at Buffalo] and small businesses all across upstate New York and focused on the economy.” At times, it felt more like she was running for senator again, taking pages from the playbook of her 2000 and 2006 races, in which she won over skeptical voters by focusing obsessively on local concerns. Her campaign highlighted upstate initiatives she’d worked on as senator. Downstate, she focused on retail politicking more typical of a mayoral candidate. Over and over, Clinton’s campaign reminded New York voters of what she’d done as senator, releasing ads highlighting some of those accomplishments. For her supporters, that message rang true.“I’m here all the way from Jamestown,” Carol Jones, 55, said at an organizing event in Buffalo on Monday, referring to a city about two hours away. “She knows where Jamestown is.”Jones said she would support Sanders if he became the Democratic nominee, but she wouldn’t be happy about it. “I’m not going to be an enthusiastic supporter [of Sanders] because I don’t believe in unicorns and fairy dust,” she said. “It’s yadda yadda yadda. ... There’s no plan to get what he wants. There’s no way it can happen. Not with the government the way it is. Hillary knows how to build those bridges, walk across the aisle and get it done.” Enter your email address:Share this slide:"
John Hodgman Pens Thoughtful Piece Explaining Why He’s Voting Hillary,172,"Former Daily Show correspondent John Hodgman took to his blog on Tuesday, the day of the New York presidential primary, to explain in some detail why he has decided to vote for Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders. “I don’t think this is a time to laugh at the Republican party,” the author and comedian wrote, insisting that Democrats not underestimate the GOP in spite of their current disarray.After dedicating most of the post to responding to Democrats’ more common criticisms of Clinton, Hodgman ultimately reinforces the point that Democrats must think longterm when considering this year’s presidential election:No one can succeed 100% of the time in our system. But I think she can foster policies that will capitalize on the initial gains made by President Obama, whom I supported and still do, and surely, if slowly, move our nation closer to the ideals that I embrace. Will it be fast? No. But there is a lot to do to shift the the nation’s policies back after the slow, economically rightward/socially intolerant swing that began with Ronald Reagan and peaked with the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004. (A swing, by the way, that was patiently planned, deliberately funded, and slow by design. Major change is ALWAYS incremental. Unless you want to have a REAL revolution, with shooting and stuff. You might. I do not.)Not to worry though, Bernie-supporting Hodgman fans: The comedian said he will “certainly vote for and work for Sen. Sanders should he gain the nomination.”To read Hodgman’s full piece, head over to his site.

Hillary Clinton Keeps Sticking It To NASA For Telling Her They Wouldn’t Accept Girls,1932,"Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton shared with US Weekly a list of 25 things people may not know about her.Most things on the list are actually well known facts about Clinton, like how she served as a U.S. senator from New York and that she’s a grandmother to Charlotte. She also used the list to once again stick it to NASA.“When I was a girl, I wrote to NASA to ask if I could become an astronaut,” Clinton said. “They wrote a very polite letter back saying they didn’t take girls.”Clinton has told the story many times before, calling the alleged rejection “infuriating.”“My dream was to be an astronaut when I was about 13 or 14 years old,” she said at a town hall event in 2009.Clinton also mentioned her appreciation for yoga, the best advice she ever received from her mother and stories about her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Read more at US Weekly.Share this slide:"
Cecile Richards: ‘A Woman Voting For Ted Cruz Is Like A Chicken Voting For Colonel Sanders’,3148,"On Monday, Planned Parenthood president and Hillary Clinton supporter Cecile Richards made the case for why Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz does not deserve women’s votes.“A woman voting for Ted Cruz is like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders,” Richards said at a Clinton rally in New York, as New Yorkers prepare to visit the polls on Tuesday. (Richards used the same analogy in 2008 when referring to former presidential hopeful John McCain.) Richards’ comparison is hauntingly accurate: Judging from the policies he supports, Ted Cruz cares about the lives of women about as much as The Colonel cares about the lives of chickens.Cruz has consistently supported legislation to defund Planned Parenthood; he opposed the Violence Against Women Act, and its comprehensive reauthorization that included the protection of LGBT, Native American and undocumented women, as well as women on college campuses; he has accepted endorsements from religious fanatics who think abortion providers should be killed, and he has supported legislation that would allow employers to discriminate against women based on their reproductive health choices.  We’re with Richards on this one — “The Colonel” analogy is pretty fitting.  H/T Cosmopolitan.comShare this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Trump And Clinton Expected To Win In New York,1174,"Unless the polls are massively wrong, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will win their respective primaries in New York. Indiana’s primary is likely to be a crucial race for Trump. And a significant number of Americans still believe Obamacare introduced death panels. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, April 19, 2016. CLINTON LEADS IN NEW YORK, BUT THE MARGIN MATTERS - Although Sen. Bernie Sanders is closing in on Hillary Clinton in the national polls, he hasn’t managed to move up much in the New York polling average. But since Democrats allocate their delegates proportionally according to the candidates’ vote shares, the margin by which she wins is important — and the polls vary widely on the margin between the candidates. In the 14 polls released since the beginning of April, Clinton has led by as little as 6 points and as much as 18 points. A narrow victory would still give Sanders a large number of the state’s 247 pledged delegates. A larger victory would add to Clinton’s delegate lead and substantially damage Sanders’ claims that he can catch up.NEW YORK REPUBLICANS FAVOR TRUMP BY A LARGE MARGIN - Donald Trump has taken 50 percent or more in every poll released in April, with the exception of a survey from the Republican firm 0ptimus, which included a large proportion of independents. Trump consistently leads the rest of the field by more than 30 points in the HuffPost Pollster averages. The question is exactly how many of New York’s 95 delegates that translates into. Trump seems almost assured to win 14 delegates awarded based on the statewide result, but the remaining 81 are allocated by congressional district, with each of New York’s 27 districts awarding three delegates to the winner in that district. That means Trump could win by a large margin statewide and still lose some delegates if individual districts support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, both of whom have been working to peel those delegates away. FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten has a district-by-district preview of where those efforts could be most fruitful for the anti-Trump Republicans.HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Kasich and Cruz have been spotted musing about the Old Testament and Dayenu-ing in recent days…The 10th Congressional District, with the city’s largest Jewish population, has the city’s second-largest Republican population. Trump has 65 percent support in the Staten Island-dominated 11th district, but looks weaker in the 10th, according to the Optimus survey. He has only 39.5 percent of the vote in the 10th, Kasich has 31.7 percent and Cruz has 21.3, meaning it’ll be a scrum to get one precious delegate.” [538] CLINTON, SANDERS AND TRUMP HAVE TRIED TO CAMPAIGN AS ‘REAL’ NEW YORKERS - Bob Tognetti: Three presidential candidates have close ties to the Empire State, and are hoping to leverage that into primary votes….But an NBC News/WSJ/Marist New York poll shows that it’s party identification, not background, that really determines whether voters think Trump, Clinton or Sanders is the most authentic New Yorker. Overall, 41 percent of registered voters in New York say Trump is the “real New Yorker” of the three candidates. Twenty-five percent select Sanders, and 23 percent choose Clinton…. Among Republicans, 76 percent believe Trump is the true New Yorker, compared to just 22 percent of Democratic voters. Meanwhile, just 8 percent of Republicans choose Clinton, compared to 36 percent of Democrats, and another 8 percent of Republicans select Sanders, versus 33 percent of Democrats. [HuffPost]NEW YORK MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST CRUCIAL STATE TO TRUMP’S NOMINATION - Nate Cohn: “If you divvy up the states by expected results, Mr. Trump wins big in the East and West Virginia, loses the winner-take-all rural Western states, and earns his expected share of proportional delegates in Washington, Oregon and New Mexico. That puts him about 175 delegates short of the required 1,237. Only two real tossup states remain: California (172 delegates) and Indiana (57). You can see the basic issue: If he doesn’t win Indiana, he has to sweep California and get some lucky breaks elsewhere, which isn’t realistic....But even though Indiana may be pivotal — it awards its delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district and statewide — the state is a big mystery because there hasn’t been a single poll there.” [NYT]  MICHIGANDERS BLAME GOVERNOR SNYDER’S ADMINISTRATION FOR FLINT WATER CRISIS - Kate Abbey-Lambertz: “One-fifth of Michigan residents polled blame Gov. Rick Snyder (R) for the avoidable lead poisoning emergency in the city of Flint...57 percent of respondents said Snyder’s administration was most responsible for the city’s water crisis. That includes the governor himself, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Darnell Earley, the former emergency manager of Flint who was appointed by Snyder….The governor’s approval rating has reached its lowest point since he took office in 2011... Though 41.8 percent of Michigan residents polled called his performance ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ in the fall, only one-quarter felt that way in the most recent poll. Meanwhile, the portion of respondents rating the governor’s performance as “poor” climbed from 20.9 to 44.1 percent.” [HuffPost] DISTURBING NUMBER OF AMERICANS THINK OBAMACARE HAS DEATH PANELS - Jeffrey Young: “New survey data reveals a depressing 29 percent of respondents still believe the Affordable Care Act includes provisions allowing a committee to cut off medical care for people at the ends of their lives. Those polled were asked, ‘To the best of your knowledge, do you think that President Obama’s health reform law establishes a government panel to make decisions about end-of-life care — sometimes referred to as ‘death panels,’ or not?’ It doesn’t. Period. But just 40 percent of the more than 1,000 people polled last month gave the correct answer. And three in 10 weren’t even sure.” [HuffPost] AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY BELIEVE TAX SYSTEM FAVORS THE RICH- HuffPollster: “Two-thirds of all Americans think the country’s tax system favors the wealthy, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Sixty-seven percent say the system is biased toward the rich, while a combined 17 percent think it favors the middle class or poor. Just 4 percent believe everyone is treated equally. That perception crosses income lines, with a strong majority in every age bracket believing that wealthy Americans have the advantage. It’s also held by both 82 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of independents. Republicans are less convinced — while 47 percent believe the tax system favors the wealthy, 29 percent think it does more to help the poor….But the real gap has to do with income level. Fifty-eight percent of Americans in households making $100,000 a year or more, and just over half making between $50,000 and $100,000, say they pay more than their fair share of taxes. Just 28 percent making less than $50,000 say the same.” [HuffPost] TUESDAY’S ‘OUTLIERS’ - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data:-Matthew Yglesias thinks Bernie Sanders’ performance in national polls could help attract superdelegates.

Samantha Bee Gets All Aroused Over Donald Trump,224,"Samantha Bee is all hot and bothered. And Donald Trump is to blame. Kind of.The “Full Frontal” host mocked the GOP front-runner’s New York state primary campaign on her show Monday night.On the eve of the election, Bee played out clips of a recent Trump rally speech in Albany — where the businessman boasted how America would “start winning so much” if he became President.He even claimed everyone would get so fed up with winning that they’d beg him to stop.It cut back to Bee, who was wearing a blindfold and writhing in faux ecstasy.“Oh my God, yeah, oh yeah, win me harder, win all over me, just try not to win in my hair,” Bee mocked.Removing the blindfold, she apologized to her audience — and lightheartedly claimed she thought was listening to her Fifty Shades of Great audio book.“I listen to the audio book because I need my hands free, to vote,” she said. “While I masturbate, I told you I was excited to vote.”Check it out in the clip above. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Would Bernie Sanders Veto A $12-An-Hour Minimum Wage Bill?,710,"During last Thursday’s Democratic presidential debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added a new wrinkle to the argument over the federal minimum wage, saying that if elected president, she would sign a bill raising it to $15 an hour — the same number championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).The current federal minimum wage is just $7.25 an hour. Throughout the primary, Clinton has argued that $12 an hour would be a more appropriate number, and that once a $12 federal minimum wage is in place, she’d encourage states and cities to go even higher if their local economies could handle it.Clinton’s stated willingness to sign a $15-an-hour bill complicated the case she’d been making for months. Sure enough, on Sunday, Clinton clarified that she would only sign such a bill under certain conditions. The new $15 wage floor would have to be phased in gradually, she said, and areas with lower costs of living would be subject to lower minimum wages to start.One thing, at least, is clear: The idea of a $12 minimum wage is negotiable for Clinton, depending on what’s politically possible. Given that, it’s not hard to wonder whether her opponent might be open to negotiation too. Would a President Sanders bend on his $15 stance and be amenable to a $12 minimum wage if that’s all he could get? Or would he veto such a bill as insufficient?The Sanders campaign won’t directly answer this question. In the spin room after Thursday’s debate, two representatives straight-out punted.“I’m not sure,” sad Nina Turner, a former state senator in Ohio and a prominent Sanders surrogate. “You would have to ask Senator Sanders. But one thing that I can say about him: He is for lifting people out of poverty and making sure that they have a living wage, and he’s been very firm about the need to raise that wage to $15 an hour. And I’ve talked to people who do need that money.”“Well, I think you would have to directly ask Senator Sanders that question,” said Symone Sanders (no relation), a spokeswoman for the campaign. “I haven’t asked Senator Sanders myself, ‘Would you sign the $12 bill or would you not sign the bill?’ But what I can say is he is a staunch advocate and proponent that we need a $15 minimum wage, that there are people in this country working 40, 50, 60 hours a week and they can’t earn enough money to put food on the table for their families. He has also said that we don’t have to settle for incremental change, and our opinion is, a $12 minimum wage is incremental change.”Having been told to ask Sanders directly, The Huffington Post did the next best thing: We emailed the campaign for clarification. A spokesman, Warren Gunnels, called back and made the case that to answer the question would be to negotiate with oneself.“[Sanders] is strongly supportive of a $15-an-hour minimum wage, and he will do everything that he can as president to make sure that Congress passes a $15 minimum wage,” Gunnels said. “I think you’ve seen during this campaign, as he’s said over and over again that he cannot do this alone, that this would take a strong grassroots movement of working people to make Congress do this. But Senator Sanders starts with a full loaf here, and the full loaf is $15 an hour. If you start off with half a loaf, you end up getting crumbs.”In short: Sanders wants $15 an hour, he will demand that Congress pass a bill for $15 an hour, and he won’t discuss what might happen if he’s unsuccessful.There’s certainly a reasonable argument to be made for this position. Minimum wages are a negotiation in Congress, and it pays to start off aiming high, knowing the opposition will try to haggle you down. In 2013, many Democrats grumbled when President Barack Obama put forth a humble $9 proposal. They later had to convince him to back their own, more ambitious bill. And much of the progress made by liberals on the city and state level has come courtesy of the aggressive push for $15. Republicans and business lobbies are much more willing to come to the table and hash out a deal for $10 or $12 when they’re worried about $15 becoming a reality.In this regard, Clinton’s and Sanders’ respective positions on the issue say as much about their approach to politics as their convictions in policy. Clinton’s openness to a $15 minimum wage could be seen as reflecting a common criticism from Sanders supporters — namely, that her positions shift depending on the situation, and that she’s too comfortable with incremental progress. Meanwhile, critics of Sanders might see his insistence on $15 as evidence that his proposals are too pie-in-the-sky to withstand the realities of Capitol Hill. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), a Clinton supporter, described the difference as being aspirational versus being pragmatic, “which in some ways describes the differences between the two candidates.”That said, there’s reason to think that Sanders would sign a $12-an-hour minimum wage bill as president — that, indeed, he might be crazy not to. Talk of “half a loaf” notwithstanding, bringing the federal minimum wage up to $12 from $7.25 would be a huge victory by almost any reasonable measure. After all, the federal minimum wage has not been raised at all since 2009 — and as Baldwin noted, when Democrats pushed for a $10.10 minimum wage in 2013,  they were met with “absolute obstruction from Republicans.” Even if Democrats take control of both chambers of Congress this November, there’s no guarantee they would have the necessary votes to get to $15.Sanders certainly knows this. Back in 2013, the Senate Democratic caucus was firmly behind the push for $10.10 an hour. Sanders himself co-sponsored the bill and argued repeatedly into the spring of 2014 that the minimum wage needed to be $10.10 an hour “at least.”In the spring of 2015, the party pushed higher. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced legislation in late April 2015 calling for a federal minimum wage of $12 an hour.But on that one, Sanders took a pass. He announced his run for the White House around that time and a few months later introduced his own $15-an-hour bill. Shortly thereafter, Sanders, who’d been making the case for $10.10 an hour not long ago, was describing $12 an hour as wholly insufficient in meeting the needs of the working poor. Why the change? Gunnels said that Sanders began listening more closely to the people at the front lines of the debate – the activists and fast-food workers – and adapted his legislation accordingly.“The told him loudly and clearly that they could not survive on $7.25 an hour, $8 an hour, $10 an hour,” said Gunnels. “If they’re going to be able to feed their families and live a life of dignity, they need to make at least $15 an hour and they also need to have a union.”Certainly, others have listened too. In short order, the Fight For $15 movement has moved from the liberal fringes to the white-hot center of the Democratic presidential primary. But so far, there’s one important constituency that hasn’t gravitated toward $15 — namely, Sanders’ colleagues in the Senate. His bill currently has five co-sponsors. Murray’s bill, for $12 an hour, has 33.Share this slide:If you start off with half a loaf, you end up getting crumbs."
HUFFPOLLSTER: Donald Trump Still Has A Substantial Chance Of Winning The GOP Nomination,511,"Prediction markets show that Trump is the most likely Republican nominee, despite weeks of bad press. Most Republican voters would be OK with Ted Cruz convincing delegates to vote for him. And Hillary Clinton isn’t only winning conservative states. This is HuffPollster for Monday, April 18, 2016. TRUMP’S LIKELIHOOD OF BEING THE NOMINEE IS REBOUNDING - David Rothschild: “Donald Trump has a 62 percent chance of being the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton has a 92 percent chance to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States of America, and the Democratic nominee for president has a 74 percent chance to win the general election. It may be surprising that Trump is still at 62 percent to win the nomination despite all of the doom-and-gloom in the press about him failing or not wanting it. But, Trump has 742 pledged delegates to Ted Cruz’s 529 and he is about to go on a roll….He is heavily favored in New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.“ [HuffPost] Note: Prediction market estimates change frequently. The above numbers were current as of the article’s publication on Sunday, April 17. It’s not just the prediction markets that say Trump is up - Bettors are probably considering polls when they make their wagers in the prediction markets, and polls show that Trump is favored to win by more than 30 points in New York’s primary on Tuesday. HuffPost Pollster’s averages also show him up by nearly 20 points in Pennsylvania and Maryland, which vote on Tuesday, April 26. There aren’t enough recent polls in the rest of the April 26 states — Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island — to calculate averages.MOST REPUBLICANS SAY CRUZ CONVINCING DELEGATES TO SWITCH IS ACCEPTABLE - Mark Murray: “According to the NBC/WSJ poll, 55 percent of Republican primary voters say it’s acceptable to them if Cruz wins the nomination by convincing the delegates from other candidates to support him….Just 38 percent of Republicans say it’s acceptable if Trump goes into the Republican convention with the most delegates but does not become the nominee, versus 54 percent who say that outcome is unacceptable. And only 20 percent say it’s acceptable if Republican delegates choose a nominee who has not run in the primaries, versus 71 percent who think that’s unacceptable.”  [NBC]  CLINTON ISN’T ONLY WINNING CONSERVATIVE STATES - Philip Bump: “Sanders’s most common articulation of Clinton’s non-liberalness is by dismissing her biggest wins as coming from more-conservative areas. He’s repeatedly waved away Clinton’s wins in the South as being from a more conservative area. Depending on how you divvy up the ‘parts of the country,’ Sanders is correct….That blurs a point that’s often been made in response to Sanders: He’s won a lot of conservative states, too, like Idaho, Oklahoma and Wyoming. Clinton has done well in a number of very-conservative states, but so has Sanders. In fact, if you take Vermont out of the mix — a very liberal state that backed its senator by a wide margin — there’s essentially no correlation between the conservativeness of the state and the margin of victory for either candidate.“ [WashPost] The states where Clinton is winning look like Obama’s coalition - Nate Silver: “Clinton’s largest net delegate gains over Sanders came from Texas (+72) and Florida (+68), two states that are within the South... Clinton also cleaned Sanders’s clock in Virginia and North Carolina. Overall, Clinton gained a net of 155 delegates on Sanders in the five Deep South states, but she also added 211 delegates to her margin in the rest of the region. In addition to being important to the Democratic Party’s electoral present and future, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Texas are quite diverse…. In fact, these states are among the most demographically representative of the diverse Obama coalition that Clinton or Sanders will have to rely on in November….Clinton has won or is favored to win almost every state where the turnout demographics strongly resemble those of Democrats as a whole.” [538] AMERICANS HAVE MIXED VIEWS ON FRACKING - Kate Sheppard and Laura Barron-Lopez: “In this week’s tight New York Democratic primary, the fight over hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is one issue of contention between Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton….Sanders’ position on fracking may help him in fracking-wary New York, but a national HuffPost/YouGov poll of 1,000 adults found that more Americans sided with Clinton’s approach of tightening regulations without banning the practice. Thirty-four percent said they ‘strongly’ or ‘somewhat’ agree with Sanders, while 41 percent said they agree with Clinton. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said the presidential candidates’ positions on fracking are important to their voting decision. Curiously, more respondents said they opposed fracking than said they supported it. Thirty-three percent of respondents ‘strongly’ or ‘somewhat’ support fracking; 37 percent said they ‘strongly’ or ‘somewhat’ oppose it. An additional 30 percent said they weren’t sure.” [HuffPost] SANDERS’ POPULARITY COULD FALL IN A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN - HuffPollster: “In an election year that’s produced a slate of notably unpopular frontrunners in both parties, Sanders stands out for his positive image.But there’s a limit to how well polling on hypothetical matchups can predict what will happen in the fall….That caveat is especially relevant in the case of Sanders, who prior to this election had a low national profile compared to his rivals. It’s undeniably to Sanders’ advantage that he’s a fresh face, especially in a year brimming with anti-establishment energy….The relative lack of political scrutiny he’s faced, though, leaves more room for Sanders to be defined negatively over the course of a general election….Sanders has also faced very little in the way of negative advertising. Of the roughly $383 million spent on campaign television advertising so far this year, only about 2 percent has gone to anti-Sanders ads, according to Elizabeth Wilner of the research firm Kantar Media.” [HuffPost] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

This One Line Sums Up The Big Clinton-Sanders Policy Argument,2786,"If you want to know why so many liberal policy wonks are exasperated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — and why so many Sanders supporters are exasperated with liberal policy wonks — you’ll find the answer in an unexciting but revealing statement Hillary Clinton made during Thursday night’s debate in Brooklyn.The subject was a familiar one: health care. Sanders has famously vowed to scrap the existing insurance system and replace it with a single-payer program, under which the government would directly provide insurance to everybody. Such systems exist overseas, in places like Canada, Sweden and Taiwan. They generally produce terrific results — providing everybody with comprehensive insurance for far less money than the U.S. currently pays.But creating a single-payer system here would be a herculean task — difficult to impose on America’s existing health care infrastructure and probably impossible to get through Congress. Even many liberals sympathetic to the idea have said that Sanders’ scheme is simply not realistic. They worry that trying to push through another comprehensive health care package so soon after the Affordable Care Act’s tumultuous enactment would produce a major public backlash.Clinton has made that argument before, and on Thursday she made it again. But during the debate she also made another claim: That under the Sanders plan, some low-income people now on Medicaid would be much worse off. “A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300,” Clinton said.If you picked up on the claim, you might have thought it was absurd, given that a major goal of single-payer is to make the poor more financially secure. But Clinton was making a (mostly) valid point. If you do the math on the Sanders health plan, you’ll quickly discover that, as written, it’d be a lousy deal for a portion of low-income people who have jobs and, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, now have insurance.Here’s why. If the federal government is going to provide everybody with health insurance, then it must raise enough money to pay for those benefits. To do this, Sanders has said he’d create a new tax on incomes, equal to 8.4 percent of payrolls. In theory, employees would pay only a portion of that, with employers covering the majority. In reality, most economists say, the employer share also comes out of workers’ paychecks, if not right away then over time.So imagine a single mom of two, with a job that pays $26,000. That would qualify her for Medicaid if she lives in the District of Columbia or one of the 31 states that, in accordance with Obamacare, made the program available to anybody with income up to 133 percent of the poverty line. (For a family of three, that’s $26,813.) The employer share of the woman’s payroll tax, under the Sanders plan, works out to $1,612. Clinton’s figure of $2,400 presumably included the employee share of the tax, but low-income workers wouldn’t pay much or any of that because of tax deductions those workers can claim.Today, by contrast, this proverbial single mother would be getting Medicaid without her employer having to pay any new taxes. The money for the program comes out of general revenue, and if you’re one of the newly eligible folks, then the money is coming almost entirely from taxes that fall on the wealthy and on corporations in the health care industry.Sanders never got around to addressing this issue in the debate. But when critics of the Sanders plan first pointed this out, his campaign noted, correctly, that the plan would have other benefits for low-income Americans. For one thing, it would reach more people because it would have automatic enrollment. Today, by contrast, millions of people eligible for Medicaid don’t sign up and remain uninsured.In addition, other low-income people would clearly be better off under the Sanders plan. For example, some low-wage workers still get insurance from employers. The cost of that coverage, plus their out-of-pocket expenses, can eat up big chunks of income. They could easily pay less, maybe a lot less, under the Sanders plan. And that doesn’t account for the beneficial effects that other Sanders proposals, including a higher minimum wage, could have on the poor.Still, reducing the compensation of some single moms making $26,000 — even indirectly — is not something Sanders, a longtime champion for the poor, would want to do. And while all policy changes have winners and losers, Sanders might try to modify his plan to further protect low-income Americans. (The Sanders campaign, for the record, disputes that employers would really pass along the costs of the new tax.)But to change his plan, Sanders would have to find new money somewhere — by seeking higher taxes from everybody else, even though the proposed increases are already high, or by squeezing the health care industry even harder for savings, even though he’d already squeeze them pretty hard.Keep in mind that many experts think the Sanders plan, as currently written, would actually require a lot more money than he has said — so asking him to go back and find yet more revenue, to cover the exposure these low-income Americans would face, is no small thing.This is the point that the liberal wonks have been making. (And, yes, I am one of those wonks.) Sanders is holding up his health care plan as an alternative to the status quo. But the status quo is a result of real-world compromises and sacrifices. If Sanders became president and had a chance to push his plan through Congress, he’d quickly discover all kinds of other complications — like the fact that many people with employer-sponsored insurance don’t want to give it up, or that severely ratcheting down payments for doctors and hospitals would reduce access and threaten real economic disruption.  To address these issues, Sanders would have to make painful concessions. What came out of the other side of the legislative process would look very different, and less attractive, from what he’s proposing now, in much the same way that Obamacare looks very different, and less attractive, from what Obama sketched out as a candidate in 2008.None of this is likely to register with Sanders supporters. They point out that Clinton has proposed only very modest improvements to Obamacare, even though millions still struggle with high premiums or out-of-pocket costs — and millions more still don’t have coverage at all. She’s said repeatedly that she wants to get to 100 percent coverage, without offering a hint of how she’d actually accomplish that. More broadly, Sanders supporters argue, this is not the time and place to dwell on details. Campaigns, in this view, are for laying out broad themes and laying down markers for future negotiations. If Sanders became president, he could say that he’d campaigned on a promise to provide more seamless and generous coverage than the Affordable Care Act has — to create a system that would rely much more on government than the private sector. He might not get his plan through Congress, sure, but he could use his promise to extract other useful legislation from Congress. Maybe he could win approval for the “public option” insurance plan that was originally part of Obamacare, or for allowing the non-elderly to buy into Medicare.These are legitimate arguments. But liberal policy wonks remember the struggle to enact and then implement Obamacare. They also also remember that universal health care was a progressive dream for nearly a century, one that proved impossible for presidents with names like Roosevelt and Truman (and Clinton!) to realize. One reason reform took so long is that, for most of that period, activists and the wonks were pulling in different directions, with the activists pursuing single-payer and the wonks looking for compromises. The (mostly) unified front they showed in 2009 and 2010 was a big reason Obamacare became law. Now that unity is fading, creating a key divide in the Democratic campaign. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the percent of payrolls that Sanders’ health care plan, as written, would tax. The total is 8.4 percent, not 8.9 percent. The article also stated that the impact of this tax on a single mother of two, making $26,000 a year, would be about $2,400. That figure is actually closer to $1,600, and that money would come almost entirely from her employer. Most economists believe that employers would eventually pass on to workers, in one form or another, although the Sanders campaign disputes that.Share this slide:"

"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders Made Some False Claims In The Democratic Debate",1050,"This story was originally published by FactCheck.org.False and misleading claims by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders included:The two Democratic presidential candidates debated in Brooklyn, days ahead of the New York April 19 primary. CNN hosted the debate.Clinton strained to blur her differences with Sanders over how high to raise the federal minimum wage.Clinton: I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. … I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate.Sanders: I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.Until now, as Clinton’s own website makes clear, “She has supported raising the federal minimum wage to $12.” That would be a big increase from the current $7.25 an hour, which has been unchanged since 2009. But Sanders favors more than doubling the rate to $15 an hour.The “fight for 15? that Clinton referred to is an effort backed by the Service Employees International Union to raise state and local minimum wages to $15 wherever possible. And her website says “we should go further than the federal minimum through state and local efforts” (emphasis added).Clinton’s position seemed to evolve during the Brooklyn debate, however. She concluded a lengthy and at times raucous exchange on the subject by saying:Clinton: I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.Sanders cited the contributions of “43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry” to Clinton as evidence that those lobbyists thought “she was a pretty good bet on this issue.” But Sanders is including lobbyists who represent many clients other than oil and gas companies.Asked during the debate about Sanders’ campaign charge that Clinton is in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry, Clinton cited small contributions from oil and gas employees.Clinton: So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. … But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it’s important to distinguish that.Sanders responded that he was not talking about contributions from oil and gas employees, but rather from lobbyists for the oil and gas industry.Sanders: It is one thing, as the secretary indicated, to talk about workers. I’m sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country. But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton’s campaign.Now, that’s not saying — and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it’s a small amount. That’s true. But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.As Sanders noted, both candidates have received money from employees of oil and gas companies. According to the most recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton has received $333,262 from employees in the oil and gas industry, and Sanders has received $53,760. That’s a tiny fraction — about 0.2 percent — of the nearly $160 million raised by the Clinton campaign so far. The overwhelming majority of money from oil and gas company employees — 97.7 percent — has gone to Republican presidential candidates.As for lobbyist money donated to the Clinton campaign, Sanders is referring to a Greenpeace analysis of fossil fuel contributions to Clinton. On April 7, we wrote about Sanders citing that analysis to back up his padded claim that “Hillary Clinton’s campaign and her super PAC have received more than $4.5 million from the fossil fuel industry.”The Greenpeace tally included contributions of $20,050 from nine in-house lobbyists for oil and gas companies, six of whom gave the maximum $2,700. It also included contributions from 45 outside lobbyists hired by the oil and gas industry (36 of whom gave the maximum $2,700). All of the lobbyists listed were registered to lobby on behalf of one or more oil or gas company since January 2015. But most of them had multiple clients, and in some cases the money they received from oil and gas companies in 2015 was a fraction of their overall lobbying income. In fact, some of them also lobbied on behalf of renewable energy companies as well.Given the multitude of industries represented by those lobbyists, Will Tucker, the money-in-politics reporter for the Center for Responsive Politics, called it “disingenuous” to classify those contributions as “fossil fuel money” going to Clinton.Sanders said that Clinton “barely mentioned the Palestinians” in a speech that she gave before The American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. But what Clinton did say about the Palestinians was similar to a point that Sanders himself made during the debate.Sanders: You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians. And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.During the debate, Sanders, who said that he is “100 percent pro-Israel,” also said that “we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity” if there is to be peace in the region between Israel and Palestine.Clinton made a similar point in her speech at AIPAC.Clinton, March 21: It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists. But inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state, in peace and dignity. And only a negotiated two-state agreement can survive those outcomes.Clinton claimed that Sanders was the first to say she is unqualified to be president. That’s inaccurate. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida used that same line of attack.Sanders last week questioned Clinton’s qualifications to be president because of her past support for trade agreements and the Iraq war. And then he quickly walked it back, saying “of course” she was qualified.During the debate, moderator Wolf Blitzer recalled the kerfuffle over Clinton’s qualifications and then asked the Vermont senator if he thought that Clinton had the judgment to be president. Sanders said Clinton had the experience and intelligence, but not the judgment.Clinton: Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I’ve been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first.It was not a first. For different reasons, Rubio and Christie made the same charge.At a Jan. 26 debate, Christie criticized Clinton for putting classified information at risk by using a private server and email account for government business. “She is not qualified to be president of the United States,” Christie said.Rubio made his remarks during a speech in Iowa on Feb. 28.Rubio, Feb. 28: Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president of the United States of America. She broke the law. She put her e-mails, private, no, classified information on her private server. She thinks she is above the law. No one is above the law. But on more serious — even more — even more serious note, Hillary Clinton on the 11 of September of 2012, lied to the families of Americans who lost their lives in the service of our country. Four brave Americans died in Benghazi and she told them, she told their families that they died because [of a] video and she knew it was because of the terrorist attack. And I’m telling you, anyone who lies to the families of those who have lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America.As an aside, we note that Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler interviewed family members of the Americans who died in Benghazi, and came away with conflicting accounts of what they say Clinton told them.Clinton glossed over the facts when asked why she said that Vermont had “the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.” Her “per capita” claim is true for guns recovered and successfully traced in 2014 — not for all guns used in crimes. But in raw numbers, Vermont is behind 12 other states to which guns recovered in New York were traced.We fact-checked Clinton’s claim earlier this week, and CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer correctly pointed out that “only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.” Vermont is a small state — 49th out of 50 in terms of population — so a per-capita measure increases Vermont’s significance, while a raw-number measure makes the state look small.Blizer asked if Clinton was “seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York’s gun violence?” She responded: “No, of course not.” When Blizer later asked why she made the claim, Clinton said: “Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state. They come from the states that don’t have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.”That’s correct, at least for guns that were recovered and successfully traced. But most of them didn’t come from Vermont.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ trace data for 2014 show 7,686 guns recovered in New York and traced in 2014, and the source state identified for 4,585 of them. New York was the source state for 30.5 percent of those guns. So “most” come from other states.While Vermont tops the out-of-state list in per-capita terms, it’s near the bottom in raw numbers. The top 14 outside sources of the guns were: Virginia (395 guns), Georgia (386), Pennsylvania (371), Florida (292), North Carolina (279), South Carolina (256), Ohio (152), Texas (103), Alabama (91), West Virginia (66), Connecticut (59), Tennessee (57), Vermont (55) and California (49).Southern states have been blamed for the problem. Back in 2013, then New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly cited the issue of guns coming from southern states, up Interstate 95, in what’s called the “iron pipeline.”As we wrote about Clinton’s claim, one statistic rarely tells the entire story, and that’s the case with using the per-capita numbers on guns from other states recovered in New York.At one point in the debate, Sanders may have left viewers with the misleading impression that the names of donors who contribute to political action committees supporting Clinton are “completely undisclosed.”Sanders: Well, let’s talk about judgment. Let’s talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed. Where does the money come from? Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she’s going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?Clinton does have significant support from outside committees, but they are all registered with the Federal Election Commission and disclose their donors.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, there are seven outside groups that have raised money to support Clinton. The largest by far is Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that has raised $55.6 million. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions, but they mustdisclose their donors.In fact, Sanders has been critical of Priorities USA Action for accepting money from donors with ties to the oil and gas industry — an allegation that can only be made because the donors have been disclosed. (We reviewed the donors and found that their ties to the oil and gas industry are tenuous at best.)The only other pro-Clinton groups that have raised more than a $1 million this campaign cycle are Correct the Record and Ready PAC. Both are so-called Carey PACs, which, as the center explains, “can maintain two separate accounts; one for contributions to federal candidates and parties, and the other for independent expenditures, to which unlimited contributions can be made.” They, too, must disclose their donors.Sanders is conflating two issues. Sanders is right when he says donors to 501(c)(4)s are “completely undisclosed.” Such groups register with the IRS and are under no requirement to disclose their donors. But he’s wrong to imply that such groups support her. And we know the answer to the question he raises — “Where does the money come from?” — for the groups that are supporting Clinton.Both candidates rehashed a previous debate disagreement about whether Sanders had once advocated regime change in Libya. Then, as in the most recent debate, both sides glossed over some context.The exchange was initiated by Sanders, who cited a New York Times story that identified Clinton as a key voice in convincing President Obama to topple Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. In an interview on Fox News on April 11, Obama said one of the biggest mistakes of his presidency was “probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.”During the debate, Sanders said, “Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.”Clinton responded, “I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support. Senator Sanders voted for that, and that’s exactly what we did.”“No,” Sanders said.“We went to the United Nations — yes, he did,” Clinton continued. “We went to the United Nations Security Council. We got support from the Security Council. And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.”Sanders said Clinton’s account wasn’t true.Sanders: Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn’t make it truer. What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue.Clinton: There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you’re not shy when you oppose something, senator. So, yes, it was unanimous. That’s exactly right, including you.We took a look at this when the exact same claims were made by both candidates during the sixth Democratic debate. Here are the facts: On March 1, 2011, Sanders cosponsored and voted in favor of Senate Resolution 85. The resolution, which was nonbinding and passed by unanimous consent, called on Gadhafi “to desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people’s demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy. …” So Sanders is correct that the resolution did not explicitly authorize or advocate for military action, though it did call for Gadhafi to resign his position.In an interview with Fox News in March 2011, Sanders made clear that he was wary of military intervention. “Look, everybody understands Qaddafi is a thug and murderer,” Sanders said. “We want to see him go, but I think in the midst of two wars, I’m not quite sure we need a third war, and I hope the president tells us that our troops will be leaving there, that our military action in Libya will be ending very, very shortly.”However, as Clinton said, the resolution Sanders cosponsored also urged the United Nations Security Council “to take such further action as may be necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory.” Indeed, a couple weeks later, the Security Council did approve a resolution calling for a no-fly zone and calling on members “to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country.”Sanders strained the facts when he attributed Clinton’s lead in delegate votes to her victories in the “Deep South,” which he said was “the most conservative part” of the United States.Sanders: Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That’s the fact. But you know what? We’re out of the Deep South now.It’s true that Clinton has swept nominating contests in Southern states from Texas through South Carolina. But she has also won in the Midwestern states of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, in the Western states of Nevada and Arizona and in the Northeastern state of Massachusetts.Furthermore, Clinton’s success in Southern primaries was widely attributed to her popularity among African American voters, not among conservatives.For a list of sources for this story, visit FactCheck.org.Share this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Voters Aren’t Likely To Go For A Third Party Presidential Candidate,269,"Independent and third-party candidates face overwhelming challenges in getting voters’ support, even if they polling well. Donald Trump’s polling numbers seem okay in the primary, but abysmal in the general election. And a research company is experimenting with polling people who dial wrong numbers. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 15, 2016.VOTERS ARE UNLIKELY TO RALLY BEHIND A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE - Matt Dabrowski (R): “Pollsters regularly ask about third-party support, often in one of two ways. One way is to ask voters if they’d support a third-party candidate in some kind of yes-no question….Another way is to add the third-party candidate to the general-election horse race question….Pollsters know that both these question styles aren’t very predictive….But there is a way to accurately gauge potential third-party support using survey research…. A potential third-party voter must reject both the Republicans and Democrats (1,2) and both the Republican and Democrat nominees (3,4). In effect, voters have to say ‘no’ four times before they’re truly open to stepping outside the two-party system, making this a four-part test….This potential pool of third-party support will wax and wane with the nominees’ favorables. And the odds are that disgruntled primary voters today will become loyal partisans in November.” [HuffPost]Post-election analysis confirms that polling non-major party candidates is tough - A comparison of polling and actual results in the 2014 midterms, presented last year by exit pollster Joe Lenksi,  found that if pollsters included the third candidate in their election tossup questions, the numbers overestimated support for that candidate. If they didn’t ask about the third candidate, though, the polls underestimated the vote share. The bottom line: it’s very difficult to poll on independent and third-party candidates. [HuffPost]REPUBLICANS ARE LESS SURE ABOUT VOTING IF THEY DON’T LIKE THE NOMINEE - Mark Blumenthal: “Seven out of ten registered voters (70%) describe themselves as ‘absolutely certain’ to vote on a Trump-Clinton contest, with 80% at least ‘very likely’ to vote. Slightly fewer (67%) say they are ‘absolutely certain’ to vote if Clinton faces a Republican other than Trump, with 81 percent at least ‘very likely’ to vote. However, these overall results mask shifting preferences among about a quarter of registered voters, with potentially important consequences for the ultimate Republican nominee….[A] quarter of Donald Trump’s backers (25%) rate their chances of voting as 50–50 or less if he is not the nominee, while a similar share of Cruz and Kasich supporters (24 and 27% respectively) say they are 50–50 or less if Trump gets the nod. Under either scenario—Trump or another Republican as nominee—the results reverse the usual pattern by party. Typically, the most likely voters are slightly more Republican than other registered voters. In this case, however, the potential hesitance of either Trump or #NeverTrump voters gives Democrats a slight edge on self-reported vote likelihood under either hypothetical scenario.” [SurveyMonkey] TRUMP’S POLLING NUMBERS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AWFUL AND OKAY - Greg Sargent (D): “The basic case for nominating Ted Cruz rather than Donald Trump is that, while Cruz would arguably be the most right-wing nominee in modern American history, and would probably lose to Hillary Clinton, he would not unleash the sort of blood-dimmed tide of down-ticket destruction that Trump would. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll lends some support to this view: It finds that Trump’s numbers are unspeakably awful among all the voter groups that Republican strategists had hoped to improve the party’s performance among in 2016.” [WashPost]... But on the other hand - Philip Bump: “[A] new CBS News poll suggests that Republicans are pretty comfortable with the idea of Trump as the nominee — or, at least, they are compared to the other two candidates….Republicans are slightly more likely to say that they would support Trump’s nomination ‘enthusiastically’ than they were last month. Overall, two-thirds of Republicans say they’d support him enthusiastically or with some reservations — a higher percentage than says that about Cruz or Gov. John Kasich. More Republicans are likely to say they’d support Kasich simply because he would be the nominee than any other reason.” [WashPost]So which is it — do Trump’s numbers show “unspeakably awful” or “pretty comfortable”? - Both are true. Trump’s numbers are awful among the general public and the minority groups that are discussed in Sargent’s piece. Among just Republicans — the group Bump is discussing — his support has declined overall, but his favorability ratings are higher than either of his opponents. The two pieces and the polls they discuss highlight a substantial gap between how Republican voters and general election voters feel about Trump and his potential nomination‘RECONNECT’ POLLING ROUTES WRONG NUMBERS TO POLLS - Eric Chemi and Nicholas Wells: “Reconnect Research works with technology that accepts inbound calls and turns them into research and polling opportunities. One problem with traditional polling is it depends on respondents answering calls from unknown numbers and using landlines. With cellphones and caller ID, most people won’t answer their phone if a random person or unknown number is calling. People hardly pick up landlines at all. However, people still have to call important numbers like banks, insurance or credit card companies. When people call those numbers and misdial, Reconnect can send that call to a researcher….Reconnect Research has been continuing to prove out its thesis. One example of this — the results of the Florida primary. Reconnect’s polling was the most accurate in measuring Democrat Hillary Clinton‘s performance...Similarly for John Kasich’s number. Reconnect’s poll was number one out of 10 polls analyzed.” [CNBC] It’s hard to assess claims of accuracy on polling released after the election - It doesn’t appear that the Reconnect Research polls were publicly released prior to the elections in Florida. As with any new way of doing polls, skepticism is warranted until there’s evidence that the method performs well over time.HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

The Democratic Debate Was A Weird Role Reversal,2237,"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders repeatedly flubbed opportunities to attack Hillary Clinton on his strongest issue during Thursday night’s Democratic debate. And then … he shocked America by outfoxing her on a foreign policy issue.Listen to HuffPost’s analysis of the debate in the latest episode of the politics podcast, So, That Happened embedded below:For much of the Democratic primary process, Clinton has bashed Sanders as a “single-issue candidate” who only cares about economic policy. This is a politically savvy way to dismiss a political opponent whose economic policies are more closely aligned with those of primary voters than your own. But when CNN opened the Thursday debate with a series of questions about Wall Street reform and big bank accountability, Sanders largely sounded listless and, at times, unprepared.When asked to name a single policy that shows Clinton had been beholden to big banks, Sanders dodged, opting for campaign talking points about her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. The question should have been an easy one for Sanders. Elizabeth Warren took Clinton to task over bankruptcy reform years ago. During the latter years of Bill Clinton’s presidency, Warren helped convince Clinton to lobby her husband’s administration against a bankruptcy bill that helped credit card companies extract more money from broke households. Then, when Clinton moved to the Senate, she supported the bill. Warren cried foul, suggesting that the campaign finance pressures of being a senator had influenced her position.Yeah, Clinton didn’t look great when she refused to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. But there’s really no way for her to make that position look good, and Clinton maneuvered into a point about Sanders’ failure thus far to release his tax returns. It wasn’t a new talking point, and Sanders was vulnerable on the issue because, well, it’s April and he hasn’t released his tax returns. He had the first half hour of the debate in the bag, and he failed to exploit his opportunities.But then something really strange happened. Sanders trounced Clinton on a foreign policy issue. When pushed repeatedly to say something, anything, negative about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton repeatedly dodged and deflected, as Sanders — the only Jewish presidential candidate to win primary delegates in American history — relentlessly pressed her on the conservative policies of the Israeli government. Netanyahu has in the past explicitly rejected the idea of a two-state solution in which Palestinians are granted their own state. Though he has at times walked back that resistance, he does not currently support efforts to pursue a Palestinian state. The international community, including President Barack Obama, considers a two-state solution the only plausible path to lasting peace between Israel and Palestinians. Netanyahu also campaigned for re-election by warning that “Arab” voters were turning out “in droves,” and very publicly supported Mitt Romney’s 2012 GOP presidential bid. He also worked to undermine Secretary of State John Kerry’s peace talks between Israel and Palestine. Instead of acknowledging disputes between the Israeli government and the Obama administration — like Netanyahu’s support for additional Israeli settlements in the West Bank — Clinton appeared to blame all of the problems in Israel on the terrorist organization Hamas, which is supported by the government of Iran. Sanders, by contrast, maintained that the Israeli government’s current policies are untenable in the long-term.“We are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity,” Sanders said, noting the 40-percent unemployment rate resulting from the Israeli occupation of Gaza. Clinton has tied herself to Obama’s legacy on domestic policy, a posture she continued to emphasize on Thursday night. But much of her foreign policy vision is a rejection of Obama’s platform, as demonstrated by her speech last month before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Her words went over well at the conference. The Democratic audience on Thursday seemed less impressed."
"New York Post Lobs GOP Endorsement To Donald Trump, Because ¯\_(?)_/¯",207,"The New York Post on Thursday endorsed GOP front-runner Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.The tabloid’s editorial board cited the “plain-talking,” “born and bred” New Yorker’s “common-sense sensibilities” and said Trump had the skills and know-how “to live up to his campaign slogan: to make America great again.”“Here’s how we see it,” the paper says in its editorial. “Trump is now an imperfect messenger carrying a vital message. But he reflects the best of ‘New York values’ — and offers the best hope for all Americans who rightly feel betrayed by the political class.”The editorial mentions Trump’s “downright coarse” language — perhaps referring to his xenophobic, sexist, and patently false statements — but notes the candidate has “never been a professional politician.”“Indeed, his political incorrectness is one of his great attractions — it proves he’s not one of ‘them,’” the editorial says.The endorsement flies in the face of an editorial published last month by The Washington Post, which warned a Trump presidency would be a “radical risk” for the country. The Washington Post chastised Trump’s “willingness to ignore facts and evidence” and his vague, often misguided statements on foreign policy. The newspaper’s Chris Cillizza called Trump’s interview with the paper’s editorial board “totally bananas.”But the New York Post links these “rookie mistakes” with what it says will make Trump “a potential superstar of vast promise.” Trump has, after all, incited many new voters to partake in the political process, the paper argues.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Hillary Clinton Calls Out Debate Moderators For Ignoring Women’s Health,7337,"Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) met in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday for the ninth Democratic debate, and once again, the moderators asked zero questions about abortion or women’s reproductive rights. The Democratic candidates haven’t received a single question on the issue during any of their debates. Clinton on Thursday called out the media for its oversight, saying the issue was a central one that the candidates need to talk about. “We’ve had eight debates before; this is our ninth. We’ve not had one question about a woman’s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care — not one question,” Clinton said.  “And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women’s rights,” she added. “We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this.”Last month, Trump suggested that women should be punished if they get an abortion. (He later tried to walk back his comments.) In response, Sanders called Trump’s remark “shameful“ but also criticized the media for focusing so much on his quips. “Because media is what media is today, any stupid, absurd remark made by Donald Trump becomes the story of the week,” Sanders told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. “Maybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America.”Clinton hit Sanders for what he said in that interview during Thursday’s debate as well, saying, “Sen. Sanders said with respect to Trump, it was a distraction. I don’t think it’s a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women.”Sanders reiterated that he has a strong record on reproductive rights and that he would “take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman’s right to choose” if elected president. The lack of questions has sparked the Twitter hashtag #AskAboutAbortion and frustrated reproductive rights advocates, who consider the issue crucial in the 2016 election. “Where the media establishment failed, champion Hillary Clinton stepped in and drew attention to the invisible crisis of abortion access in this country,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, which has endorsed Clinton and pushed for discussion of the issue at the debates. Abortion has come up only during GOP debates. The one time it did come up with Democrats was during a March forum hosted by Fox News. That, however, was a town hall and not a debate. This piece was updated with comment from Ilyse Hogue.  Enter your email address:Share this slide:"
Bernie Sanders Is Running Against Hillary Clinton And Losing Against Time,2289,"BROOKLYN, N.Y. — When Bernie Sanders’ announced his presidential campaign in a patchwork press conference outside the U.S. Capital on a sunny day a year ago, even the most starry-eyed supporter could not have conjured up the image of Thursday night’s Democratic debate.That voters in New York would play a consequential role in the primary one year later was unimaginable. That Sanders would still be in the running was wishful thinking with a dab of delusion.And yet, there was the Vermont senator, sharing a stage with Hillary Clinton for what will likely be the last time — a relatively hastily assembled forum at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where a vast expanse of old warehouses have been retrofitted into offices for a whiskey distillery, a glass block factory, a film and television production studio and a company that, among other things, makes sleek steel staircases for the homes of the rich. It’s a microcosm of the post-industrial economy that has colored much of this campaign.The night had all the elements of a movie: The native son, back home, making one last impassioned plea to fellow New Yorkers to propel him past the better known former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. Had Aaron Sorkin penned the script, Clinton would have walked off the stage after Sanders’ opening remarks, the futility of responding coming into full view with his soaring prose.But campaigns are messy. They aren’t broken into clean theatrical acts. And even the most heart-tugging debate moments are complicated by things like delegate counts, primary rules, election calendars and, yes, the fact that the “villain” in this particularly drama happens to be admired and supported by many others.Sanders had himself a good night in Brooklyn in what was a cantankerous affair. He questioned Clinton’s judgment on the Iraq War (“the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country”); called out an opaque answer she gave about support for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour (“history has outpaced Secretary Clinton”); and took her and her husband to task for the use of the phrase “super predator” during their advocacy for the 1994 crime bill.“It is a racist term and everybody knew it was a racist term,” Sanders said, in one of the sharpest exchanges of the night.He also stumbled a bit at times, failing to point to a specific decision Clinton made that was influenced by her donors (when one exists); and getting caught snickering at Clinton’s attacks on him when the tone of the debate grew somber as the topic switched to gun violence.“This is not a laughing matter. Ninety people on average a day are killed or commit suicide,” Clinton quickly shot back.But the scorecard for the night — the jeering from the crowd, and the acid-tongued digs between the candidates — didn’t carry as much import as the surrounding context. Come Tuesday’s vote in New York — where the polls currently favor Clinton — the math will remain Sanders’ enemy and the nomination will remain elusive.“I think we’re going to win this nomination to tell you the truth,” Sanders said toward the end of the debate, in what sounded more like an effort to convince the skeptics than a measure of confidence. “Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South, no question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That’s the fact. But you know what, we’re out of the Deep South now, and we’re moving up.”Like the senator, Sanders’ aides were sanguine about his chances — as campaign flacks are paid to be. Even before the debate, his top strategist, Tad Devine, regaled reporters with his vision of how the nomination would be won.It looked something like this: Sanders would compete through June — that much was certain — and when the last contest was done, neither he nor Clinton would have the necessary number of pledged delegates to clinch the nomination (2,383), The outcome would be left to the so-called superdelegates — the party insiders that can vote for whoever they want at the convention — at which point, Sanders would make the case that he was more electable and stronger in the states that the Democratic Party needed. Many of those 469 superdelegates committed to Clinton would be won over. Not in dribs and drabs, mind you, but in a wave — what Devine called “Flip Day” — thereby sealing the deal.“The truth of the matter is neither candidate at the end of this process will have the pledged delegates necessary to win,”said Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver. “So we are going to go into a convention, an open convention, just like the Republicans. No one’s going to have a majority.“A couple of things will come into play,” Weaver continued. “One of the big things is who can beat the Republicans in the fall. The polls have been consistent over a couple of months now. Bernie Sanders has been consistently much stronger against Republicans than Secretary Clinton, particularly if it is not [Donald] Trump.”It’s not an entirely impossible theory. Another top Sanders’ aide argued that the month of May could end up being a sweep for Sanders. Notably, the aide raised the prospect of “external factors” tripping up Clinton before the convention.“Things happen in campaigns,” he said, in a clear but unstated reference to probes into Clinton’s email use.But the Sanders campaign’s rosy outlook sidesteps certain question marks.For example, Clinton will likely be ahead in the pledged delegate count, even if she remains short of the number needed to clinch the nomination. Currently, she has won 1,289 pledged delegates, compared with Sanders’ 1,038. And absent a tidal wave of support for Sanders, she’s going to be leading in popular vote too. According to Real Clear Politics, Clinton has 9.3 million votes, to Sanders’ 6.9 million. For Sanders to make the case at that point that superdelegates should switch to him would take a monumental sales pitch and an inspired bit of chutzpah — a campaign whose supporters believe the primary hasn’t been small-d democratic suddenly insisting that the person with the most votes doesn’t deserve the nomination.In a reflection of this difficulty, Sanders came into the debate sharp and biting — a distant approach from the early debates, when his memorable moments were the attacks he chose to skip. He moved swiftly to highlight lapses in Clinton’s ethics and judgment — demanding that she release the transcripts of her speeches to financial firms; making the case that her ties to Wall Street pull her toward corporatism. “Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she’s going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?” Sanders asked.But Clinton was no passive participant. She gave as good as she got, sometimes with rhetorical flourishes that seemed more Victorian than outer borough.“This is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the insinuations that he is putting forward in these attacks,” Clinton said.By the second hour of the debate, as the topics turned to the efficacy of global climate treaties, the merits of NATO, and whether the U.S.-led intervention in Libya was merely shortsighted or strategically stupid (or both), the tempers and pace cooled. Surely enough, the conversation began to fall into the same squabbles that marked many of the debates prior.Sanders aides took to the spin room to argue that the night had been a thorough, unambiguous win. But there was no evident knockout blow. And for a candidate who needed a jolting evening, that probably won’t do.Share this slide:"
Bernie Sanders Stumbles On Guns And Sandy Hook Families,2846,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) struggled to explain his position Thursday on whether Sandy Hook families should be able to hold the manufacturer of the AR-15 gun used in the 2012 massacre liable in a wrongful death lawsuit.Sanders voted for a 2005 law that grants immunity to gun manufacturers for injuries caused by their products. Since then, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act has been used by gun manufacturers and retailers to quash hundreds of lawsuits filed by victims of gun violence. The law is deeply unpopular among Democrats, and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) voted against it. “They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue,”  Sanders said in the CNN Democratic debate. But “if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don’t believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued,” Sanders added. The weapon used in the Sandy Hook mass shooting was purchased legally by the shooter’s mother. So, what Sanders was saying is that he believes the Sandy Hook victims should have a right to sue — and lose.When Clinton pointed out that Sanders voted five times against the landmark Brady gun-control bill, Sanders retreated to a position more often used by pro-gun advocates, namely, that government must “make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them.” And while Sanders said he supports a ban on military-style automatic firearms, or  “assault weapons,” he insisted that the gun industry plays no part in America’s epidemic of gun violence."
Bernie Sanders Hits Hillary Clinton For Using A ‘Racist Term’ In 1996,4897,"While sparring over criminal justice policy during Thursday’s Democratic primary debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) accused Hillary Clinton of using a “racist term” in 1996.Clinton has faced significant criticism for previously using the word “super-predators,” a now-debunked term that she said at the time referred to children with “no conscience, no empathy” who were committing crimes and had to be brought “to heel.”At a campaign event in New York City earlier this week, Sanders jabbed Clinton for using the phrase, calling it “unacceptable.”“I think we all know what that term meant in the context that it was said years ago,” he said. “We know who they were talking about.”He took that criticism a step further when asked during the debate to explain why he had called Clinton out.“Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term,” he responded.At a campaign fundraiser earlier this year, Clinton apologized for her past remarks.Sanders’ jab came during a broader discussion about the 1994 crime bill, a piece of legislation that Clinton championed as first lady and that Sanders voted for as a member of the House. It is widely accepted that the law contributed to an era of mass incarceration by implementing harsh penalties for lower-level offenses, which had a disproportionate impact on communities of color and the poor.On Thursday, Clinton said the law included positive aspects, like the Violence Against Women Act, but that the sentencing requirements of the bill were problematic.“There were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct,” she said. “I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for nonviolent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, the states piled on.““I’m sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people’s lives,” Clinton added. Sanders largely agreed, suggesting that the bill’s net impacts had been catastrophic.“We have a broken criminal justice system,” he said. “We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. In my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.”Sanders then pivoted to drug policy, saying it was time to turn away from an approach that has for decades tried — and failed — to address drug use with strict punitive measures and aggressive law enforcement.“We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs,” he said. “Too many lives have been destroyed because people possess marijuana. Millions over a 30-year period. That’s why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substances Act.”Sanders has introduced legislation in the Senate to do just that. The bill would remove weed from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s list of the “most dangerous” drugs, giving states a green light to legalize pot for recreational or medical use without federal intervention. It would also allow for expanded research on the medical benefits of marijuana.Share this slide:"
It Wouldn’t Be A Democratic Debate Without Men Criticizing Hillary Clinton’s Voice,11297,"Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) faced off Thursday in a debate in Brooklyn, New York, just five days before the state’s primary. As expected, things got heated.Also as expected, several prominent male political reporters and pundits criticized the former secretary of state’s voice.For the love of God, please stop.Sadly, this is a frequent line of attack against Clinton, during both debates and speeches. Earlier this year, legendary Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward said he was annoyed with her “screaming,” and Fox News host Geraldo Rivera was concerned that she may have “a hearing problem.”While most of the criticism has come from men, they insist it isn’t sexist, even though male candidates, like Sanders and the Republican presidential contenders, rarely receive the same critiques.Sanders also raises his voice during speeches and in tense exchanges at debates. At one point on Thursday, both candidates were yelling over each other so loudly that moderator Wolf Blitzer had to pause the debate.“If you’re both screaming at each other, the viewers won’t be able to hear either of you,” he said. Clinton herself made note of the double standard in March.But even when she does adopt “a very calm and measured voice,” she gets called out for being “too calm.” So as we’ve said before, when you’re a woman with a voice, you can’t really win.Share this slide:"
"Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Have A Tense Exchange Over Who Is ‘Qualified’",939,"CNN’s Wolf Blitzer went straight for the elephant in the room to open Thursday night’s Democratic presidential primary debate: the bitter accusations that have passed between the candidates’ campaigns in recent days.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came under fire earlier this month for implying that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was “not qualified” to be president of the United States. Women who support Clinton found the comment particularly insulting because of its gendered implications.Sanders has claimed that it was merely a response to the Clinton campaign’s insinuation that he was not qualified, which was in a Washington Post article headline. Neither Clinton nor her campaign has said that explicitly.Sanders has said Clinton is qualified because of her political experience, but that he questions her policy judgment. He reiterated that argument on Thursday.“Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be president? Of course she does,” Sanders said. “But I do question her judgment.”He went on to list her vote for the Iraq War, her receipt of campaign donations from super PACs and other decisions as evidence of this flawed judgment.Clinton was not having it.“I’ve been called many things in my life,” Clinton said of the “not qualified” descriptor. “That was a first.”“The people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to name me secretary of state,” Clinton added.She went on to cite Sanders’ grilling at the hands of the New York Daily Newsearlier this month as evidence that he is unprepared on policy.“Talk about judgment, talk about the kinds of problems he has answering questions about even his core issue: breaking up the banks,” Clinton said.Sanders finished the exchange by again enumerating the policies on which he believes Clinton has exercised flawed judgment such as the Iraq War and the influence of big money in politics.Share this slide:"

Clinton announced plans this week to set up an Office for Immigrant Affairs should she win the White House, and the Sanders campaign hit her for past opposition to driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants in New York.In fairness to the moderators, though, the candidates' positions on immigration reform have been discussed in detail in previous debates, and many of their stances are similar. Most of their recent jabs over immigration are about two things that happened in 2007: Clinton spoke out against driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants and Sanders voted against a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Clinton now supports driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants on the state level, and Sanders supported a different comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013.Elise FoleySanders Presses Clinton To Clarify Social Security PlanCNN’s Wolf Blitzer pressed Hillary Clinton on whether she supports lifting the cap on earnings taxed for Social Security in order to shore up the program’s finances. Clinton has pledged she will not cut the program, and would expand benefits instead, but she has not committed to a specific plan for doing so. “I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security trust fund,"" Clinton said. Lifting the cap on earnings, she said, ""is one way.” Currently, Americans contribute to Social Security on the first $118,500 they earn.Clinton went on to say that she favors taxing wealthier Americans to close Social Security’s funding gap and to fund targeted benefit increases for vulnerable groups, like older widows. Clinton hinted that she is interested in proposals that would increase taxes on unearned income, like capital gains, to improve Social Security’s finances as well.“We’ve gotta help people who are not taken care of now,” Clinton said. “And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out.”“Interesting comment, but you didn’t answer the question!” Sanders shot back.""Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes passive income,” Sanders said.A bill Sanders introduced to lift the cap would indeed also tax a greater share of investment income for Social Security. The back and forth turned into one of the most contentious exchanges of the night. And Clinton clearly found herself on the defensive.“We are in vigorous agreement on that, Senator,” Clinton said of the need to tax the rich to pay for Social Security.“Think about what the other side wants to do,” she added. “They are calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.”Sanders wasn’t tolerating Clinton’s ambiguity, though. He insisted that she weigh in on a specific proposal.“If I hear you correctly now, you are coming out in favor of lifting the cap on income for Social Security. ... I’m glad to hear it,” Sanders said.Clinton settled on embracing a mix of different revenue increases, then noting that none of the progressive reform proposals would be possible if Democrats do not retake Congress.“It is always a little bit challenging because if Sen. Sanders doesn’t agree with your approach to doing something, he calls you a member of the establishment,” she said.The policy debate over Social Security has evolved dramatically on the Democratic side in recent years. While it was conventional wisdom among Democrats a few years ago that Social Security needed to be cut, a progressive activism campaign has shifted the discussion to expansion of benefits as a remedy for retirement insecurity. Openness to cuts is now a vulnerability for Democratic candidates in tense Senate primaries. Daniel MaransHillary Clinton Calls Out Debate Moderators For Ignoring Women's HealthFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chastised the moderators for not asking a single question about women's reproductive rights during any of the Democratic debates that have happened so far:There is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law, and Citizens United needs to be overturned. And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.We've had eight debates before; this is our ninth. We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care -- not one question.And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this.And to be complete in my concern, Sen. Sanders said with respect to Trump, it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women.In response, Bernie Sanders said he would ""take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose.""Indeed, none of the debate moderators have asked Clinton and Sanders about abortion or reproductive rights, although the issue has come up at Republican debates. It did, however, come up in March during a Fox News Democratic town hall in Detroit. The lack of questions has sparked the Twitter hashtag #AskAboutAbortion and frustrated reproductive rights advocates, who see the issue as central in the 2016 election. Amanda TerkelMeanwhile... Bernie Sanders Shares Mind Meld With Donald Trump On NATO AllianceIt turns out that Bernie Sanders and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump share a similar worldview when it comes to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an alliance of 28 nations that brought stability to Europe in the aftermath of WWII.Trump has criticized the alliance as ""obsolete"" and expensive, and he views it as an inadequate tool to address terrorism.Asked about his views on the matter on Thursday, Sanders agreed that European nations ought to bear more of a financial burden to maintain the alliance in comparison to that of the United States.""To say to our European allies, the United States of America cannot just support your economies, put up your fair share of the defense burden -- there's nothing wrong with that,"" Sanders said.Hillary Clinton struck a different tone.The former secretary of state acknowledged that members of the alliance ought to pay their fair share, but insisted that the alliance played a key role and should not to be curtailed.""I will stay in NATO,"" Clinton said. ""Of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't, we leave.""""Yes, we have to work out financial aspects, but let's not what's forget what's happening with Russia...think of what it would cost if Russia's aggression was not deterred,"" she added. Igor BobicBernie Sanders Flips And Flops On Guns And Sandy Hook FamiliesSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) struggled to explain his position on whether Sandy Hook families should be able to hold the manufacturer of the AR-15 rifle used in the 2012 elementary school massacre liable in a wrongful death lawsuit.Sanders voted for a 2005 law that grants legal immunity to gun manufacturers for injuries caused by their products. ""They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue,"" Sanders said in the debate, referring to the Sandy Hook families.But ""if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued,"" he added.What Sanders was saying is that he believes the Sandy Hook survivors should have a right to sue -- and lose.When Hillary Clinton pointed out that Sanders voted five times against the landmark Brady gun-control bill, Sanders retreated to a position familiar to pro-gun advocates, namely, that government must ""make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them.""And while Sanders said he supports a ban on military-style automatic firearms, or  ""assault weapons,"" he insisted the gun industry plays no part in America's epidemic of gun violence.Christina WilkieFormer Obama Aide Credits Bernie Sanders On Climate Stance, Dings Hillary Clinton On Libya    David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama, has in the past argued that the Democratic National Committee has favored Hillary Clinton with its policies. Daniel MaransFormer Obama Aide Credits Bernie Sanders On Climate Stance, Dings Hillary Clinton On Libya    David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama, has in the past argued that the Democratic National Committee has favored Hillary Clinton with its policies. Daniel MaransA Reminder Hillary Clinton And Barack Obama Are Split On Middle East PolicyHillary Clinton's strategy of agreeing with President Barack Obama doesn't go beyond the water's edge.

She also implied that her experience as first lady during her husband's administration, when the economy was booming, makes her uniquely qualified to promote job growth.It is a claim Clinton has made before. And indeed, the economy in the late 1990s produced some of the most widespread wage growth in decades.The implicit link to manufacturing policy is certainly tenuous, since former President Bill Clinton’s North American Free-Trade Agreement resulted in significant manufacturing job losses.But many economists believe that the late '90s jobs boom was due to the patience of the Federal Reserve, which allowed the economy to grow uninhibited rather than raise interest rates. Clinton has yet to present her vision for the powerful central bank.Daniel MaransDingell Ding  Clinton Just Supported A $12 Minimum Wage And A $15 Minimum Wage In The Same Answer""I have said from the very beginning that I've supported the Fight for 15,"" Hillary Clinton said Thursday night.She was referring to the national campaign to raise the hourly minimum wage to $15, and it was the type of remark that epitomizes what Clinton opponents dislike about her brand of politics. She supports the movement, but she doesn't support its goal.Bernie Sanders pressed her on her support for the Fight for 15, and she eventually conceded that she only supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour. (Some economists warn that $15 per hour would cause significant job loss in low cost-of-living areas, and Clinton has made the argument.)In Thursday's debate, though, Clinton didn't make the economic case, she made the pragmatic one. She said $12 an hour was more politically feasible. But, she added, ""If we have a Democratic Congress, we'll go to 15.""Which raises all sorts of questions: Does she really think that Republicans in Congress would actually approve a $12 hourly minimum wage?And unless she's saying that a Democratic Congress would override her veto of $15 per hour, that last comment means she now supports that higher minimum wage.Ryan GrimHillary Clinton Voted To Deregulate Wall Street Derivatives, TooEarly in the debate, Hillary Clinton said that Bernie Sanders was the only candidate on stage who had voted to deregulate swaps -- complex contracts at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. It's true that Sanders voted for this. It's his one pro-Wall Street vote. But Clinton voted to deregulate swaps, too. During her tenure in the Senate, Clinton backed a bankruptcy reform bill that was heavily criticized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). That bill deregulated swaps. Warren's bill to reinstate Glass-Steagall financial regulations would reverse the language Clinton supported.Zach CarterBernie Sanders Is Not Sorry For Blasting Verizon CEOCNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Bernie Sanders how he would promote businesses abroad when he has so much “contempt” for large corporations. Blitzer cited the example of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam critiquing Sanders for speaking out against Verizon management’s bargaining position against its nearly 40,000 striking workers.McAdam cited the investments the company has made in Sanders’ home state of Vermont as evidence that the Vermont progressive does not know what he is talking about. (Verizon owns AOL, HuffPost’s parent company.)“For a start, I would tell the gentleman who is CEO of Verizon to start negotiating with the Communications Workers of America,” Sanders responded. “This is a perfect example of the kind of corporate greed that is destroying the middle class of this country.”“He is not investing the way he should in inner cities in America,” Sanders added.Blitzer pressed Sanders to explain how he would promote U.S. businesses abroad.Sanders challenged the idea that he has contempt for all large corporations.“There are some great businesses that treat their workers and the environment with respect,” he said.He reserves his disdain, he said, for companies like Verizon and General Electric, which outsource jobs, bust unions and pay little or no taxes.Daniel MaransHillary Clinton Explicitly Rejected A $15 Minimum Wage In NovemberHillary Clinton is trying to paint herself as a defender of a $15 minimum wage. In a November debate, Clinton explicitly rejected a $15 federal minimum wage, and likened her position to that of ""progressive"" economists. She backed an increase to $12.Zach CarterClinton Isn’t Budging On Speech TranscriptsHillary Clinton skirted questions Thursday on why, if her paid speeches to big banks and corporations have nothing worth hiding, she won't just release the transcripts.CNN host Dana Bash noted that Clinton has said in the past that she will release transcripts to paid speeches when all of the other candidates do -- Republican and Democrat. But why not release them now, Bash asked, if there are no problems?At first, Clinton didn't answer it at all, instead going back to a previous point. When pressed again, she repeated that she would release them once everybody agreed to do it, prompting boos from the crowd. Bash pointed out that it's the Democratic primary now, and Democratic voters want to see them. Clinton didn't shift her answer.""Let's set the same standard for everybody,"" Clinton replied. ""When everybody does it, okay, I will do it. But let's set the same standard on tax returns.""Elise FoleyWhere Bernie Sanders' Wealth Ranks In CongressBernie Sanders promised to release his taxes, and he said his 2014 returns will be out in the coming days.""They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate, and that's what that will show.""According to Roll Call, Sanders ranks as No. 340 out of No. 541 in Congress in terms of wealth. His net worth is $160,000.Amanda TerkelClinton Overstates Her Wall Street Record, AgainHillary Clinton repeatedly said she went to Wall Street before the crisis and told the banks to stop doing bad things. This is a gross exaggeration of her record.She actually said in her 2007 speech at Nasdaq that ""Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis."" By suggesting that she may at some point support legislative action to curb the foreclosure mess, Clinton sent a clear signal to financiers that she would not back already-moving legislation to help struggling homeowners in foreclosure.Clinton has said this at every debate. She exaggerates it every time.Zach CarterBefore Things Heated UpBrian Snyder / ReutersHillary Clinton shakes hands with Bernie Sanders at the start of their debate.Why The Rowdy Audience? Sanders Misses Obvious Opportunity To Ding Clinton On Wall Street Bernie Sanders missed an easy opportunity to attack Hillary Clinton on her ties to Wall Street early in the debate. When asked to cite a specific policy where Clinton had been influenced by big bank money, he dodged and pointed to her paid speeches for Goldman Sachs.Sanders has flubbed this question before. There's an obvious answer: Bankruptcy reform. Elizabeth Warren took Clinton to task over this issue years ago. During the latter years of Bill Clinton's presidency, Warren helped convince Clinton to lobby her husband's administration against a bankruptcy bill that helped credit card companies extract more money from broke households. Then, when Clinton was elected to the Senate, she supported the bill. Warren cried foul, suggesting that the campaign finance pressures of being a senator had influenced her position.Zach CarterSanders And Clinton Open Debate With Tense Exchange Over Who Is ‘Qualified’CNN’s Wolf Blitzer went straight for the elephant in the room to open the debate: the bitter accusations that have passed between the Democratic presidential candidates' campaigns in recent days.Bernie Sanders came under fire earlier this month for implying that Hillary Clinton was “not qualified” to be president of the United States.

""I will move immediately to break up any financial institution,"" Clinton said in the debate. Presumably, there are some qualifiers to that promise. But the longer this primary goes on, there'll be fewer and fewer.Ryan GrimClinton Emphasizes New York Connections Right AwayWhile Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) gave a modified version of his stump speech in his opening statement, raising familiar issues like overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Hillary Clinton immediately got hyper-local, reminding viewers that she spent eight years as a senator from New York.Clinton's campaign backed her up with an email to reporters that outlined her ""record of delivering real results"" for the state, including spurring economic development, funding clean energy initiatives and advocating for aid for the state following the 9/11 terror attacks.Samantha LachmanThe Stage Is ReadyBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe stage stands before the start of the Democratic presidential candidate debate in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., on Thursday, April 14, 2016. "
Trump Campaign Manager Will Not Be Prosecuted For Battery Charges,353,"Prosecutors announced Thursday that they will not prosecute Donald Trump’s campaign manager on battery charges against a female reporter, saying they did not have enough evidence to bring a case.Michelle Fields, formerly a reporter with Breitbart News, alleged in a police report that Lewandowski grabbed her arm following a March press conference at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. Fields tweeted a photo of bruises and had her account corroborated by a reporter from The Washington Post. Trump’s campaign initially said Lewandowski never touched Fields, but changed its story after police charged Lewandowski with simple battery, saying Fields could have hurt the candidate.Part of the reason Lewandowski won’t be charged is because prosecutors said it was reasonable to believe he was reacting to what he perceived to be a threat against the candidate. At a Thursday press conference, prosecutors showed reporters a video of the interaction that they said showed Fields touching Trump and the candidate recoiling.“We are not charging him because he was reacting to what he perceived as a potential threat to someone he is in charge of,”said Adrienne Ellis, a deputy to Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg.Ellis said that Fields told her she did not touch Trump. The deputy added that when the incident occurred, Fields was in a scrum in a protective area she was instructed not to be in.NBC’s Katy Tur, who covers the Trump campaign, said it was common for reporters to go right up to Trump following an event on his property.“There’s an area where they put the press, but when Donald Trump leaves the stage or walks around and it’s in one of his properties, we are free to walk right up to the candidate,” Tur said on MSNBC. “The Secret Service usually is surrounding him, but there have been a number of situations where you’re told one thing but you’re a reporter so you go up and you’re trying to get a comment.”“There have been a number of circumstances where members of the press, including myself, have walked right up to Mr. Trump in that scrum and stood next to him for quite a while and asked questions as they’ve been walking along,” she continued.Aronberg and Ellis also revealed Trump had personally called them to give his version of events and urged them to “do the right thing.” They said that neither Trump’s call, nor politics, had factored into their decision.Trump’s campaign released a statement shortly after prosecutors announced the decision, saying Lewandowski was “gratified” by the decision to drop the misdemeanor charge.During an interview with reporters and activists at Trump Tower on Thursday, Trump asked Lewandowski to explain how loyal Trump had been during the incident and its fallout, according to The Forward.“More than I could possibly fathom,” Lewandowski said.Trump then went on to praise his campaign manager.“I’m proud of you, Corey,” he said. Perhaps alluding to the struggles his campaign has faced recently, he added Lewandowski “wasn’t quite as effective for the past couple of months.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Dem Senator Breaks From The Pack To Endorse Bernie Sanders,14886,"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) is supporting Bernie Sanders for president, he said in a blog post on Wednesday. “Hillary Clinton has a remarkable record. She would be a strong and capable president,” Merkley said. “But Bernie Sanders is boldly and fiercely addressing the biggest challenges facing our country... people know that we don’t just need better policies, we need a wholesale rethinking of how our economy and our politics work, and for whom they work.”The Oregon lawmaker’s endorsement is a sharp diversion from his colleagues. Of the 44 Democrats in the Senate, 40 have supported Clinton. Those backers include fellow Oregon senator Ron Wyden and Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.)“Having somebody who is identified more as a socialist in many decades of public service than as a Democrat makes it impossible for Democrats in a state like Missouri,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.) said. “And it makes it very difficult for Democrats in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.”Three other Democratic senators, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.) have not made endorsements. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) has also not endorsed anyone.Clinton is leading Sanders in both polls and delegate counts. But all’s not lost for the Vermont senator.

Ted Cruz And Donald Trump Supporters Probably Won’t Defect To A Third-Party Candidate,150,"More than a quarter of Donald Trump’s supporters would rather vote for a third-party candidate in November’s general election than cast a vote for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — and a similar share of Cruz’s supporters feel the same way about Trump.That’s according to a new NBC News/Survey Monkey poll that appears to offer evidence of a deep schism between supporters of the two leading Republican presidential candidates. But things may not be as simple as that. Only about half of each candidate’s supporters say they would vote for the other man. Many supporters on each side say they’d vote for a third-party or independent candidate, without even knowing who that candidate might be. But there are two big reasons to be skeptical of this actually happening: November is a long way away, and voters just don’t usually support third-party candidates in large numbers. (Sorry, buddy.)There are seven months left until the general election, and research has shown that in a normal election year, polls would already be starting to predict what November’s results would be. However, nobody would describe this as a normal election year.All 2016 general election surveys are hypothetical — NBC uses the term “theoretical” in its write-up of this latest poll. Neither party has a presumptive nominee. In all likelihood, November’s election will see either Trump or Cruz squaring off against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but there’s a lot of uncertainty on the Republican side, and it looks like the GOP will remain locked in a bitter fight until at least the beginning of June.That presents a problem when you’re asking people, especially Republican voters, to anticipate their general election vote. Trump leads in the delegate counts and in polls, but Cruz is stealthily using the party rules to his advantage and gaining delegates in some states. As long as both candidates are still competitive, there’s no incentive for anyone who supports one of them to say they’d be willing to vote for the other — even though Cruz’s only real path to the nomination is by way of a contested convention.The other reason to doubt that large numbers of Trump or Cruz supporters would defect from Republicans if their candidate isn’t the nominee is that Americans don’t vote for third-party candidates in large numbers — despite stated support for third parties in polls. Now, as already noted, this is a weird election season in a lot of ways, so we can’t necessarily rely on history to be our guide. Still, the pattern in recent elections is clear.In April 2012, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked likely voters nationwide if they would consider voting for a third-party or independent candidate. Forty percent of people said they would consider it — even though by then it was fairly clear that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) would be going up against President Barack Obama. Come November, fewer than 2 percent of voters actually voted for a non-major party candidate.Similarly, in May 2008, when Obama and Clinton were in the midst of a protracted nomination fight, a George Washington University national poll showed that 28 percent of Clinton’s supporters said either they’d refuse to vote for Obama if he won the nomination, or they weren’t sure what they’d do. According to national exit polls, 89 percent of Democrats voted for Obama in November that year."

An Important Reminder That The Pay Gap Is Not Just A ‘Women’s Issue’,788,"There are a lot of ways critics like to explain away or trivialize the gender pay gap — the sad fact that women make 79 cents for every dollar a man earns in the U.S.One of the more popular strategies for minimizing the issue is to label it a “women’s problem,” Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said Tuesday at a forum on equal pay.That is absurd, of course. Women make up half of the population — even if the pay gap were solely “our problem,” it would be a huge freaking problem. Or think about it this way: If women were paid fairly for their work, essentially half of the country would get a raise. “When we’re talking about unequal pay for women we’re talking about half the population,” Valerie Wilson, a director at the Economic Policy Institute, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “Certainly if you raise pay for half the population, that’s clearly going to have an impact on the American economy.”If women participated in the workplace more equally to men, that could add an estimated $2 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next 10 years — or about the equivalent of the economy of the state of Texas, according to a report out earlier this month from McKinsey and Company. The report did not expressly consider the effects of closing the wage gap, but instead looked at three factors that help drive pay inequality between men and women: Women do not participate in the workforce at the same level as men do, and more women work part time and tend to work in lower-paying sectors. Other factors behind the pay gap — like gender bias — weren’t considered.McKinsey examined what would happen if you got more women into the labor force, into more full-time jobs and into higher-paying sectors. “This isn’t just a gender issue, it’s GDP growth for the entire economy,” Kweilin Ellingrud, a partner with McKinsey and co-author of the report, told HuffPost.Women are increasingly the breadwinners for their families, so when they earn more money that’s incredibly significant.Closing the pay gap would also be particularly meaningful for those Americans who are living in poverty.The poverty rate for working women would be cut in half, to 3.9 percent, if we had equal pay, according to a 2014 report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.And the very high poverty rate for working single mothers would drop to 15 percent from 29 percent. That means children would be lifted out of poverty as well. Closing the pay gap would also have profound implications for older women, who are more likely than older men to live in poverty.  So the next time someone suggests that pay equality is a women’s thing, you can set them straight."
John Kasich Can’t Believe What Donald Trump And Ted Cruz Want To Do As President,1450,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) on Tuesday unleashed a pointed critique of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, ridiculing their proposals and calling them unworthy of the office of president.Kasich, who has stubbornly refrained from criticizing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in recent weeks, broached the subject in an address in New York City in which he urged Americans not to go down a “path to darkness.” While he did not mention the two men directly by name, he took issue with some of their greatest hits: a ban on Muslims from entering the country, surveillance of Muslims in the U.S., dropping out of the NATO alliance, allowing nuclear weapons in Europe, and promising to repeal Obamacare “simply through the will of a strong man in the White House.”“I have stood on a stage and watched with amazement as candidates wallowed in the mud, viciously attacked one another, called each other liars and disparaged each other’s character. Those who continuously push that type of behavior are not worthy of the office they are seeking,” Kasich said at a campaign event in Manhattan.The Ohio governor also laid into Trump for dividing Americans by religion and skin color. “The response for some is to retreat into the past — to yearn for ‘the way things used to be,’” he said. “To these people, today’s America is only seen as a broken place, and the people who did the breaking are ‘the other’: people with more money — or less money, people with different-sounding last names, or different religious beliefs, or different colored skin or lifestyles or — whatever.” Kasich badly trails both Trump and Cruz in crucial delegates needed to secure the party’s nomination in Cleveland later this summer. His chances in doing so before the convention are basically zero, leading some to question his decision to remain in the race. Last month, the governor shot down the prospect of serving as vice president. Trump, however, named him as a possible ticket-mate on Monday.    Share this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Donald Trump And Hillary Clinton Are Struggling With Some Female Voters,426,"Donald Trump is strongly disliked by married women, while Hillary Clinton struggles to pick up support from young women. Few Republicans plan to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, regardless of the GOP nominee. And President Obama’s approval ratings are staying out of the red. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, April 12, 2016. MARRIED WOMEN DISLIKE TRUMP - Mark Niquette: “Seventy percent of married women who are likely general-election voters have an unfavorable opinion of the Republican front-runner, according to the Purple Slice online poll conducted by Purple Strategies for Bloomberg Politics. Almost 60 percent said the way Trump talks about women is offensive and embarrassing and makes him unacceptable as a presidential candidate, and more than half said the billionaire is setting a new low in negativity….Women, particularly single women, tend to vote Democratic, but the married women subset has leaned more Republican. In the 2012 election, married women preferred Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama 53 percent to 46 percent, and since 1996 Republican presidential candidates have won the married women vote, according to Gallup….In a general-election match-up, the Democratic front-runner defeats Trump 48 percent to 36 percent, while against Texas Senator Ted Cruz, she is in a tie at 43 percent.” [Bloomberg]  FEMALE VOTERS’ AGE GAP ON CLINTON IS DRIVEN BY LIFE EXPERIENCES - Lori Poloni-Staudinger, J. Cherie Strachan and Brian Schaffner: “Clinton hasn’t resonated much with young voters, including young women. In fact, Sanders beats Clinton among young voters overall by as much as 60 points, while Clinton loses young women by about 30 points….Democratic women who said they had been discriminated against because of gender were more likely to choose Clinton over Sanders, even after accounting for ideology, age and income….Older women are more likely to report that their education or career had been affected by gender discrimination and caring for children….In most age groups, Clinton supporters report higher levels of child-care responsibilities limiting their choices than do their comparable Sanders supporters….Fewer younger women have seen their prospects limited by discrimination and child-care responsibilities. Here’s what they have faced personally: being part of the generation hardest hit by the Great Recession, and seeing student debt and poor job prospects as major career obstacles.” [WashPost]  FEW REPUBLICANS SAY THEY’D VOTE FOR CLINTON - Hannah Hartig and Stephanie Psyllos: “[A]ccording to the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll...When given the choice between Clinton, Cruz, a third party candidate, or not voting, registered voters are fairly split between Clinton and Cruz... When asked about Trump as the GOP nominee in November instead of Cruz, registered voters are split between Clinton and Trump, though the race is tighter...[O]nly about half of Cruz supporters and half of Trump supporters said they would vote for the other GOP candidate in a general election... In a theoretical November contest wherein Clinton and Trump were the candidates, 56 percent of Cruz supporters would vote for Trump and a quarter would vote for a third party candidate. Similarly, 53 percent of Trump supporters would vote for Cruz and 28 percent would vote for a third party candidate if their options in November were between Clinton and Cruz.” [NBC]General election matchups are still hypothetical - Both parties are still in the midst of a primary election fight. It’s fairly clear what the outcome will be on the Democratic side, but the Republicans could battle all the way to the convention. Until the nominees are set, general election polls remain hypothetical and not predictive of what could happen in the fall. TRUMP IS WEAKEST CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY - Harry Enten: “Trump’s 37 percent of the cumulative primary vote and 46 percent of delegates won so far may sound impressive, but his percentages make him the weakest Republican front-runner, at this point in the process, in decades. Of course, a front-runner is still a front-runner, but by historical standards Trump is limping along — hence the increased chances of a contested convention….Past GOP nominees...had bigger shares of the vote at this point, even if they started out slowly….You’ll also note that past nominees tended to increase their delegate and vote leads from this point forward, mostly because their rivals had faded or dropped out...Trump isn’t so lucky. Ted Cruz is almost certainly going to fight hard all the way to the last primaries on June 7 and beyond.” [538] OBAMA’S APPROVAL CONTINUES TO RISE - Kathleen Hennessey and Emily Swanson - “As many in the United States hold their noses in the search for the next president, they’re increasingly warming to the president they already have. Buoyed by some good economic news and a surge of goodwill from his base of supporters, President Barack Obama is seeing his approval rating rise….For the first time since 2013, half of those questioned approve of the job Obama is doing in office, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll. The survey found the apparent uptick in approval extended across issues, including foreign affairs, immigration and, most notably the economy, where people said they felt slightly better about their own prospects and Obama’s stewardship. Asked about their opinion of Obama more generally, those surveyed were more likely to give him a positive rating than any of the candidates for president, Republican or Democrat.” [AP]The president’s average rating tops 50 percent - HuffPost Pollster’s chart of all publicly available polling has shown Obama’s positive ratings rising since December. His approval rating now stands at approximately 50 percent mark, a point last achieved in February of 2013. The uptick is mirrored in his ratings among Democrats and independents, and he’s even up a tiny bit among Republicans, where his 13 percent approval is up from 10 percent in late 2015.

Heidi Cruz Gets A Boost In New York From Trump ‘Nastiness’ Backlash,225,"MINEOLA, N.Y. — Heidi Cruz showed no interest in relitigating Donald Trump’s threat to “spill the beans” on her when she greeted supporters at a field office in this working-class Long Island suburb on Monday.Cruz, the wife Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, instead told the crowd how she’d begun her investment banking career in New York and how pleased she was to return to the state to campaign for her husband ahead of the April 19 primary. She said nary a word about Trump’s cryptic threat last month that further battered the last thin walls of civility surrounding the 2016 GOP campaign. Nor did she bring up Trump’s retweet of a meme that juxtaposed an unflattering photo of her with a glamor shot of Trump’s wife Melania, a former model.But many of the spirited and candid women who showed up to greet Heidi Cruz were eager to tell a reporter they hadn’t forgotten what Trump did.“Terrible, terrible, terrible,” said Hanni Planos of Mineola, when asked about Trump’s social media assaults against Heidi Cruz. “I mean, he’s terrible. No decent man does a thing like that.” Planos said that she agreed with Trump on many issues and would vote for him in a general election over Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. But Trump’s treatment of Heidi Cruz was a turning point, she said.“I don’t like nastiness,” Planos said.Maureen Daly, who heads Cruz’s field office in Mineola, said many of the women who’d offered to volunteer for Cruz recently had cited Trump’s attacks on the candidate’s wife as motivation.“He has no respect for women, and for many people coming in, that whole ‘spill the beans’ comment had a big effect,” Daly said. “It is a disgrace. And a lot of people came in and said, ‘No, that is the final line that he crossed. Disgraceful, and we’re not going to allow it.’” Time and again, Trump has said things that have brushed aside common standards of taste and decency, and time and again he has defied the predictions of his imminent political demise.And as he maintains a massive lead over Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in his home state, Trump’s standing among Republican women here remains robust.In a Fox News poll released on Sunday, Trump earned the backing of 49 percent of female Republican voters in New York — a significant drop from the 59 percent of GOP men he was winning in the state — but more than enough to maintain his commanding lead overall.But Trump’s trend lines among female GOP voters nationwide have been heading downward, and his unfavorability with women overall is now hovering around 70 percent.Trump’s abysmal standing with female voters is a consequence of many factors. But the conservative women who came to see Heidi Cruz said they had been particularly appalled over his onslaught against her.“When he did that, he totally distracted from the truth because he can’t argue facts,” said Ryan Boulton, a stay-at-home mother from Huntington, who attended the Cruz event with her four young children. “The president of the United States, the leader of the free world, you have to have class … I mean, that’s like a 14-year-old.”Boulton emphasized that she is not “one of those sensitive people to call the ‘offensive police’ all the time.” But she said she would vote for a third-party candidate or write-in someone’s name if Trump wins the Republican nomination. “I have voted for many Republicans that I’ve kind of held my nose for,” Boulton said. “But I could not in good conscience vote for him because of character. And people say, ‘You’re wasting your vote, or it’ll be Hillary.’ You know what? I have a conscience, and I’m going to do the right thing.”Just how damaging to Trump’s campaign was his self-inflicted attack on Heidi Cruz?Trump’s own admission to The New York Times’ Maureen Dowd that it had been a mistake was both an exceedingly uncommon moment of self-reflection, as well as an even rarer acknowledgment of the extent to which he’d damaged himself politically.And the wounds remain highly visible in conversations with women like Barbara Schaffer of Lindenhurst. Schaffer said that she had not yet committed to supporting Cruz and was still exploring her options. But Trump’s attacks on Heidi Cruz were the final straw, she said.  “I’m all for taking care of us first and taking care of the border and all of that, but I just — he’s too much of a ‘Jerry Springer Show,’” Schaffer said of Trump. “I don’t even want to look at him.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
Two Of Donald Trump’s Kids Won’t Vote For Him In The New York Primary,3677,"Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump told “Fox & Friends” Monday that he won’t be receiving votes from two of his children in the New York primary on April 19.Both Eric and Ivanka Trump waited too long to register to vote, missing the cutoff and quashing any chance they had to cast a ballot for their famous father.“They had a long time to register, and they were unaware of the rules, and they didn’t register in time,” Trump said in a phone interview. “So they feel very, very guilty. They feel very guilty. But it’s fine, I mean, I understand that.”Trump incorrectly claimed New Yorkers “have to register a year in advance” to vote. Residents are actually required to register at least 25 days prior to an election. (Here’s how you can register to vote no matter where you live.)“So Eric and Ivanka, I guess, won’t be voting,” Trump said before joking he’d take away their allowance for the mistake.A Fox News poll released Sunday shows Trump leading his rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in New York ahead of the state’s primary.UPDATE: Trump later clarified he was talking about his children changing their party registration to Republican before the primary, which had an October deadline.Share this slide:"
The Washington Post Plans To Write The Book On Donald Trump,174,"NEW YORK — The Washington Post has assigned more than two dozen reporters and researchers to work on a Donald Trump biography that the book’s publisher is calling the “most thorough and wide-ranging examination” of the GOP hopeful’s public and private life.Washington Post investigative political reporter Michael Kranish and senior editor Marc Fisher will co-author Trump Revealed, which will be published by Scribner on Aug. 23. According to a release, the “comprehensive” account will cover Trump’s early days in Queens, his “turbulent careers in real estate and entertainment” and his “astonishing rise” as the Republican front-runner. Trump has written his own boastful accounts of his life, and his business dealings have been the subject of less-flattering books, including Wayne Barrett’s out-of-print Trump: The Deals and The Downfall and Tim O’Brien’s more recent TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald. But the Post’s book is clearly pegged to Trump’s candidacy and will hit shelves after the summer conventions and in time for the final months of the 2016 race. Investigative books on presidential candidates and their campaigns used to drop months, or even years, after voters went to the polls. But as the political news cycle has accelerated, so have publishing schedules. Newsweek, which had fielded a separate reporting team to produce its quadrennial election post-mortem, ended the project during that 2012 cycle. Meanwhile, Politico churned out four e-books in the midst of the 2012 race. The Post’s editors decided earlier this year that they wanted deep biographical coverage of the Republican and Democratic nominees “to be our most distinguished political work,” the paper’s national editor, Scott Wilson, told The Huffington Post. They considered different strategies, such as publishing a reconstruction of the race after the election, and assembled two teams of reporters. Kranish, who joined the Post in November from the Boston Globe and was leading one reporting team, had previously co-authored The Real Romney with colleagues at his former paper before Mitt Romney wrapped up the 2012 Republican nomination. Kranish had his agent informally gauge book publishers’ interest in the 2016 election on behalf of the Post, and unsurprisingly, there was a desire for a book about Trump.And Marty Baron, who now runs the Post but was the Globe’s editor when it published The Real Romney, will oversee the Trump Revealed project. “Donald Trump is a presidential candidate unlike any we’ve ever seen before,” Baron said in a statement. “His candidacy and his positions have defied all conventions and upended the political landscape. Given that he could ascend to the most powerful position in the world, Trump’s life and career deserve to be explored in the greatest depth. That’s what we intend to do, with a huge investment of reportorial and editing resources and with a staff that consistently has led the field in covering his volatile candidacy.”The Post reported in February 2015 on Trump’s presidential aspirations when most political journalists and pundits believed the reality show star was engaged in another publicity stunt. Throughout the race, the Post has covered Trump exhaustively, publishing an average of 92 articles that mentioned him per day last month both in print and online, according to the Washingtonian.While the Trump campaign has denied credentials to journalists from several news organizations, Post reporters and editors have received good access to the candidate and were granted a couple of interviews in recent months. Fisher spoke to Trump in January for a feature on the creation of “The Apprentice” and how his reality show fame helped propel him in the media-saturated 2016 race. But the Trump campaign has refused to answer some of the Post’s questions for critical reports on his charitable giving.Though the business mogul has given the Post interviews for articles that may now be used and expanded upon in the book, it’s unclear if his campaign will continue to grant the same level of access if the conversations are used in an unauthorized biography. Wilson said the Post informed Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks on Friday about the book project. The campaign suggested the Post had been disingenuous in seeking access for newspaper stories that could now be part of a book, he said.Hicks did not respond to a request for comment. But the Trump campaign won’t have to wait until August to find out what’s in the biography, because the Post intends to regularly publish stories from the book in the coming months. Wilson said the Post is “kind of flipping the script” on how news organizations generally produce such books. “We’re going to be writing the book in real time and harvesting off stories from our reporting,” Wilson said. “We will be writing chapters in the book and then editors here will take those chapters and make them into newspaper stories.”Wilson said the Trump campaign will be asked to comment when the Post publishes a story that may later factor into the book. And the Post won’t be holding back any scoops in the process of working on the larger project. “We’ll be seeking their input just as we would doing the journalism we’re doing every day,” Wilson said. “And certainly, at the end of the process, early this summer, we very much hope to sit down with them and address any outstanding questions we have for them and believe that they should have a chance to respond to before we publish anything.”Wilson said the Post plans on publishing an ebook on the Democratic nominee, though not until after the Trump book is wrapped up. The Post currently has about 12-14 reporters across the national, investigative, style, sports and local desks who are working full time on the Trump project. Several top Post political journalists involved in Trump coverage this cycle will not be directly involved day-to-day with the book project. That includes Robert Costa, who is considered to have some of the best access to the Trump campaign, according to sources. Political reporter Philip Rucker, who’s covered Trump extensively, is also reportedly not on the book team. Chief correspondent Dan Balz, known for his big-picture election analysis, said in an email he was not involved. National correspondent Karen Tumulty also said in an email she’s not a part of the book team, but would help with the project by providing anything she comes across in daily reporting that’s considered relevant.Unlike Newsweek, which divided its election staffers into a magazine team and a post-election book team, the Post’s wall will be “fairly porous,” according to Wilson. He emphasized that journalists who aren’t directly part of the book team can still provide tips for their book-reporting colleagues — or vice-versa, if the book team comes across time-sensitive information that should be published right away.One Post reporter who has been a part of daily Trump coverage, Jenna Johnson, has taken a break from her campaign coverage to work on part of the book. When that’s done, she’ll return to the campaign trail. Bob Woodward, who recently interviewed Trump alongside Costa, told HuffPost in an email that he would contribute reporting to the book. Woodward, who has authored or coauthored 17 books since helping break the Watergate scandal for the paper, made clear that he was not writing it. “I currently have no book project but am helping the Post with campaign coverage,” Woodward said in an email. “This is because the election is obviously one of those pivot points for the country—perhaps for the world.  I guess I would liken it to the 9/11 attacks when I dropped everything to work for the paper.”Thought the Post is investing major resources into the Trump book, it’s possible there will be a contested convention and the Republican front-runner won’t even be the GOP nominee by the time the biography hits shelves. But Wilson said that even if that happens, the Trump phenomenon will still be worth reading about after Aug. 23.  “We really do believe that Donald Trump is going to be a major figure in the political conversation for some time to come,” he said.  This story has been updated to include comments from The Washington Post’s national editor, Scott Wilson.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
Bernie Sanders: ‘Something Is Clearly Lacking’ In Hillary Clinton’s Judgment,13335,"Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Sunday questioned rival Hillary Clinton’s temperament for the highest office in the land.In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the Vermont senator clarified his criticism of the former secretary of state last week, in which he said she isn’t “qualified” for the White House.“The point that I was making, which is absolutely correct, is that if you look at where she is getting the money from Wall Street, another powerful special interest, she voted for the war, she cited Henry Kissinger, in a sense, as a model for her,” Sanders said. “I think those issues will tell the American people that in many respects, she may have the experience to be president of the United States. No one can argue that. But in terms of her judgment, something is clearly lacking.”In a separate interview that aired Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sanders again took a swipe at Clinton and her qualifications as president.“I have my doubts about what kind of president she would make,” he said.The two candidates jockeying for the Democratic presidential nomination both spent the weekend campaigning in New York, which holds its primary contest on April 19. According to a Fox News poll released Sunday, Clinton leads Sanders 53 percent to 37 percent in the state. Share this slide:"
Donald Trump Convention Manager Accuses Ted Cruz Of ‘Gestapo Tactics’,1329,"Donald Trump’s new convention manager accused Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign of using “Gestapo tactics” after the senator’s organization swept Colorado’s delegates on Saturday, shutting out the real estate mogul and further increasing the chances of a contested nominating convention in Cleveland.“Well, he’s threatening, you go to these county conventions, and you see the tactics, Gestapo tactics, the scorched-earth tactics,” Paul Manafort said of Cruz in a Sunday interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”The Gestapo was the secret state police of Nazi Germany, the regime’s main tool of oppression in Europe.Manafort, who helped manage the 1976 Republican convention for former President Gerald Ford, added that the Trump campaign would be filing “several protests” because Cruz’s campaign wasn’t “playing by the rules.”“Well, there’s the law, and then there’s ethics, and then there’s getting votes. I’m not going to get into what tactics are used,” Manafort said. “I happen to think the best way we’re going to get delegates is to have Donald Trump be exposed to delegates, let the delegates hear what he says. He’s done very well so far in putting himself in position by virtue of communicating.”In fact, it is Trump’s circle that has been suggesting uncouth tactics. Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone, friend and former lobbying partner of Manafort, last week threatened to make public the hotel room numbers of delegates who switch from Trump to another candidate.Trump’s campaign appeared to have been out-organized by Cruz’s team at several state GOP conventions — where crucial delegates are elected. In Louisiana, Colorado, South Carolina and Iowa, Cruz’s superior grass-roots team has racked up favorable delegates whose support he will need should the convention vote require multiple ballots.A spokeswoman for Cruz did not immediately return a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
This Is A Really Dumb Way To Fix Poverty,2065,"Poverty is what happens when people do not have enough money to live decently. It’s a difficult problem to solve if there aren’t any other people who actually do have enough money to live well. Fortunately, we live in an era in which there are many rich people who control extraordinary wealth, which makes solving the poverty problem much less complicated for us. We can take money from people who have too much and give it to people who do not have enough.This is the basic economic function of core aspects of the American social safety net — the minimum wage, food stamps, Medicaid, the Earned Income Tax Credit and, to a lesser extent, Social Security and Medicare.But there is an alternative vision that says the moral logic underpinning these programs is wrong. Zach Beauchamp illustrates it for Vox, but it is endemic to the worldview of the Beltway professional class. This doctrine describes itself as “free trade” economics, and its moral logic goes like this: Poverty cannot be solved by taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor. Instead, poverty should be addressed by taking money from the slightly-less-poor and giving it to the somewhat-more-poor. This dispute over what to do about poverty is important, because Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been challenging the free trade doctrine on the 2016 presidential campaign trail, and unlike GOP front-runner Donald Trump, Sanders seems to actually care about the plight of the global poor. Free trade advocates therefore feel compelled to explain to Sanders that he is being irrational.“Free trade is one of the best tools we have for fighting extreme poverty,” Beauchamp writes. “If Sanders wins, and is serious about implementing his trade agenda ... he will impoverish millions of already-poor people.”Free trade is an economic policy that, as Beauchamp notes, damages the American working class to allow some people in the developing world to have slightly higher incomes. By gutting manufacturing jobs in the United States and shifting them to low-wage countries where workers are willing to accept far lower pay, free trade has raised wages for many people abroad. Opponents of this policy are therefore enemies of the global poor, according to free trade evangelists.This is morality laundering, in which the otherwise obvious tenets of a belief system are channeled through econo-speak and the complexities of international law to hide their actual meaning. The primary beneficiaries of declining labor costs are, of course, not workers. They are corporate shareholders and executives. These people are also known as “rich people.” Since the adoption of the World Trade Organization system and the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, the wealth controlled by the richest Americans has increased dramatically while the real wages of everyone else in the domestic economy have declined. The upshot of this system, then, has been to take money from the American middle class, give some of it to the global poor and give tons of it to the global elite.Clearing away the rhetorical obfuscation deployed by its advocates, we can restate the two basic moral principles of free trade this way. First: economically insecure people in the United States have it too good. They do not deserve the higher standard of living that could be achieved by using trade policy to enhance their well-being. Second: the financial elites who reap the overwhelming share of benefits from free trade deserve to be very rich. It would be wrong to arrange markets in such a way that these people ended up with less money.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has spent years decrying America’s “makers and takers” problem. The social safety net was becoming a “hammock” that permitted lazy people to waste away, fueling poverty, he said. The poor, in other words, had it too easy.Even Ryan has since apologized for this rhetoric. But the core moral idea behind free trade is similar, if we substitute trade policy for welfare as the mechanism used to elevate the incomes of the American workers. Free trade is Paul Ryan 2012 gone international. No wonder he’s a strong free trade advocate.Proponents of free trade make a host of empirical claims about its effects, including that it boosts economic growth in poor countries and lowers prices for consumers in rich countries. Beauchamp doesn’t spend much time with the latter point, since even its advocates acknowledge that getting to shop at Walmart is pretty shoddy compensation for losing a good job — and anyway, he’s focused on the super-poor, who live in other countries. Beauchamp does spend a lot of time arguing that free trade has boosted economic growth in poor countries. And it has! But there is no reason to believe that the only way poor countries could have achieved that growth was to conduct trade policy exactly the way we have for the past 30 years. If this economic growth was so valuable to poor countries, maybe American negotiators could have required them to allow their workers to form unions.The bald fact is that free trade often does not result in meaningful wage increases for workers in low-wage countries (see: NAFTA), which makes it pretty hard to see why it’s such an awesome poverty-fighting tool. Shifting the global supply of labor to poor countries over the past few decades has also resulted in a corresponding surge of financial capital to the United States. That wave of money didn’t go toward helping the poor and middle class in the U.S. — it went into asset bubbles that caused international economic calamities. Don’t take my word for it; ask Ben Bernanke. But even if none of that empirical landscape were real, the moral code implied by free trade true believers is simply ridiculous. Anyone serious about fixing poverty should be talking about taking money from rich people, not the poor.Share this slide:Actions curated in support of equality and sustainability everywhere.

Young Voters Couldn’t Hate Donald Trump Much More Than They Already Do,2673,"GOP front-runner Donald Trump’s poor standing among female voters has attracted most of the attention in recent weeks, but his candidacy may be even more toxic to voters under age 35. A new NBC News/SurveyMonkey election tracking poll pitting Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton against her two possible Republican rivals finds that young voters lean Democratic regardless of the candidate, but they’re practically allergic to Trump.Against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Clinton wins the vote of 18 to 24-year-olds by just 7 points. Against Trump, her margin rises to 25 points. There’s a similar gap for older millennials, ages 25 to 34, who give Clinton a 19-point edge against Cruz and a 33-point edge against Trump.While Cruz also performs modestly better than Trump among women, the difference is substantially more muted. Both Republicans lose female voters overwhelmingly to Clinton.It’s not entirely clear why Trump fares so much worse than Cruz among young voters, but there are a few possible explanations.Millennials as a group may lean toward Clinton, but they’re not particularly excited about her. According to exit polls in Democratic primaries, they’ve voted by astonishing margins for her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who wasn’t tested against the Republican candidates in this poll.Cruz, who’s Clinton’s junior by 23 years, has aggressively courted young voters, according to The New York Times, hiring an “army” of millennial state directors and emulating then-Senator Barack Obama’s “grass-roots, guerrilla campaign that empowered young people” and helped him defeat Clinton the first time she ran for president in 2008.But if younger voters aren’t completely sold on Clinton, they’re almost united in opposition to Trump — and that alone could seal her victory among millennials.Another explanation may be that young voters simply don’t know enough about Cruz to feel the same level of distaste for him that they do for Trump. While the NBC/SurveyMonkey question didn’t ask how familiar voters were with each candidate, a recent Economist/YouGov poll shows that 18 percent of Americans under 30 said they didn’t know how they felt about Cruz, while just 4 percent said the same thing about Trump. Another recent poll conducted by the Democratic firm GQRR found that while millennials’ interest in the election has ticked up sharply since last year, they’re still paying far less attention to it than other age groups.But if these numbers hold, nominating a candidate who is this unpalatable to young voters could create a serious problem for the GOP — and not only in this year’s election. Research suggests that young voters who develop loyalty to one party often stick with it.“The ages 14 to 24 are the most formative years for political leanings, according to hundreds of thousands of survey responses...This idea isn’t so different from what marketers have learned: They often focus on making pitches to the young because older people have already developed brand loyalties,” the Times’ Toni Monkovic wrote last month. “The problem for the Republican brand is that a third straight election in which the young vote decisively for Democrats — even if the G.O.P. wins this November — could imprint negative perceptions that last decades.”The SurveyMonkey tracking poll interviewed 12,116 voters through an online panel between March 28 and April 3.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Lindsey Graham: Vital U.S. Allies Are Dumbfounded By Trump,1185,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump isn’t just a threat to the Republican Party, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Thursday, he’s also endangering the stability of U.S. allies in the Middle East, who are “dumbfounded” by the real estate mogul’s pronouncements.Graham recently returned from a tour of nations around the Middle East aimed at coming up with a broad international plan to quiet the region’s growing unrest. But besides all worries about Iran, ISIS, refugees and faltering economies, a persistent concern he heard about was Trump, who has declared that all Muslims should be banned, at least temporarily, from entering the U.S.Asked to describe foreign leaders’ reactions, Graham said they were like “Boy, who is this guy? Like, what’s going on?” he said. “[They were] just dumbfounded that somebody running for president of the United States would suggest that the United States ban everybody in their faith. It’s not helping them help us.”The idea of banning Muslims alone was especially damaging to leaders like Jordan’s King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who are both looking for ways to counter rising extremism in the region and have professed a desire for reform, Graham said. (Sisi, a former general, is a controversial example to cite — activists and scholars say his oppressive rule in Egypt may actually be radicalizing the country’s youth, and his actions in neighboring Libya have helped prolong the security vacuum there that ISIS has exploited.)“I cannot tell you how that one statement was unnerving,” he said. “Because if you’re riding this tiger like el-Sisi and King Abdullah, and you’re trying to have a relationship with the United States and Saudia Arabia, that was a pretty hard blow to absorb.”Other statements by Trump have also sparked alarm, Graham said, such as his suggestion that the United States team up with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Syria.“Suggesting that maybe working with Putin is a good thing in Syria — most of them believe it’s not. Because when you’re working with Putin you’re working with Iran,” he said.Graham, who endorsed Jeb Bush and then Ted Cruz after he dropped his own bid for the White House earlier in the primaries, said he spent a lot of time trying to reassure the officials he met.“I’m telling them that in my view, his policy positions don’t represent the Republican Party, they represent him,” he said. “We don’t want to ban all Muslims.”“They’re very much bewildered by the election process, like I am,” Graham said. “I tried to reassure them. I said, look at the response of the Republican Party to to some of these comments. It’s been wide. I’ve been proud of it, from Ted Cruz to Jeb Bush to Lindsey Graham, that we’re not going to ban all Muslims.”“I told them, just hang in there,” he added. “This is the silly season. It will pass.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"

Questioning Hillary Clinton’s Qualifications Doesn’t Sit Well With Women Backing Her,21138,"When talking to women rooting for Hillary Clinton, one reason comes up over and over again about why they stick by her: She is, simply, the most qualified person to be president. “She’s the most highly qualified candidate of the Republicans and the Democrats. She has the experience,” New Hampshire state Rep. Mary Heath (D) said during a canvassing event in Manchester in January.“She’s the most qualified, the smartest person. Her grasp of the issues is just amazing,” agreed Kathy Sullivan, a former chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.Responses like those are why Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) recent comment that Clinton isn’t qualified to be president have caused such a backlash with her supporters. Sanders’ comments — his sharpest criticism to date of his Democratic presidential primary opponent — came during a speech he delivered Wednesday in Philadelphia. “She has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, quote unquote, not qualified to be president,” Sanders said. “Well let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton: I don’t believe that she is qualified if she is — if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds,” he said. “I don’t think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC. I don’t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq.”Sanders also cited Clinton’s support for “virtually every disastrous trade agreement,” and specifically the Panama Free Trade Agreement, as additional reasons why she is not qualified. Clinton never said Sanders is “not qualified to be president,” as the senator claimed. She did, however, repeatedly demur on questions about Sanders’ qualifications during an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday. Clinton said his rough interview with the New York Daily News on April 1 showed that Sanders has been “talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn’t really studied or understood, and that does raise a lot of questions.”Sanders’ criticisms of Clinton focused on her policy positions, but to many of her supporters they came off as a personal insult. “There are policy disagreements he may have with her on some things. Let’s stick to those,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. “Let’s not say that the most qualified candidate for president is simply unqualified. Frankly, I don’t get that. And I think we’ve got to refrain from ad hominem attacks that — there’s a different way he could have put that.”Female Clinton supporters often get defensive when reporters ask them whether they’re backing Clinton because she would be the first woman in the Oval Office. They stress that it’s about her qualifications more than checking a box on the gender list. “It’s not only that she would be the first woman president,” said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. “It’s literally that she brings decades of experience in foreign policy, in domestic policy, in advocacy, and she would start day one in the White House knowing exactly what needs to be done.”And especially for many older supporters, they have heard throughout their lives that they’re not as qualified as their male counterparts, and they relate personally to the struggles Clinton has faced — the double-standards, the questions about her ambition and the focus on her appearance. In other words, if this woman — who been first lady, a senator, secretary of state and spent years in the legal and advocacy worlds — can’t be president, what hope is there for any other woman? “Nothing can be tougher than having your boss tell you you can’t have the raise you deserve because the other guys are married and have kids,” said Joni Salvas, 74, a Clinton volunteer in Manchester who had worked in manufacturing.“Hillary has been through that too, absolutely. But not as bluntly as I have,” she added. Salvas said she eventually left that field because “I don’t have a military pension, I don’t have a penis and I’m getting the hell out of this joint.”Sanders’ comments sparked a pro-Clinton hashtag, #HillarySoQualified, where supporters expressed their outrage. (The hashtag eventually backfired, however, when anti-Clinton folks used it to tweet against her.) Sanders Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver stood by the senator’s “unqualified” remarks in a CNN interview Thursday morning, saying, “If you look at her campaign, her campaign is funded by millions and millions of dollars from Wall Street and other special interests. She really made a deal with the devil, and we all know the devil wants his money in the end.”On Thursday, Clinton brushed off Sanders’ comments, calling them “a silly thing to say.”Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting.

Hillary Clinton Has A General Election Pivot Problem,910,"Hillary Clinton’s loss to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Tuesday’s Wisconsin Democratic primary hasn’t dramatically altered her still-favorable path to the nomination. But it has heightened concerns within the ranks of her campaign of losing a precious political commodity: time. Sanders’ 13-point Wisconsin win ensured that his melee with Clinton will last at least through April, with its delegate-rich contests in New York and Pennsylvania. Absent Sanders blowouts in both of those states, the math for the nomination will remain quite advantageous for Clinton.But it likely won’t be so clearly in Clinton’s favor as to allow her campaign to turn attention and resources fully toward the general election. And increasingly, top Democratic operatives worry that the longer it takes for Clinton to make that full pivot, the more the party ends up squandering the tremendous hand it’s been dealt.“Once you get into May, I think you’ve got to start having your state directors in place. You have got to start traveling to those [battleground] states. You’ve got to start communicating to voters in those states,” said David Plouffe, who was Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign manager. “Now, again, [the Clinton campaign] will make the decision. But having been through this, I think the one mistake you can make is start too late.“You can’t wait till June 8 to start the general election,” Plouffe added, referring to the day after the last primaries are held. “That would be a feat of epic political malpractice.” Plouffe, who backs Clinton, has fairly unimpeachable credentials on the subject of general election pivots. While steering Obama’s campaign in ‘08, he recalled feeling anxious that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) would use the months after he secured the nomination to effectively define the race before Democrats had chosen a nominee. Obama and Clinton were still tangled in their own primary. And the then-Illinois senator could ill-afford to look presumptuous, even with his delegate lead. A portion of Clinton supporters were, at the time, proudly disrupting Democratic events, calling the opposition a “cult,” and giving themselves the PUMA moniker: Party Unity My Ass. It was wild.But McCain didn’t use his time well. And that, said Plouffe, “was the gift that we were given.” Once Obama won in Indiana and North Carolina in early May, the campaign “started traveling to battleground states that had already had their primaries,” said Plouffe. “We started to talk a lot more about the matchup between Barack Obama and John McCain.” Unless you’ve been comatose for the last eight years, you know how the rest went. Clinton now occupies the same position Obama did eight years earlier: a likely nominee, but not quite a presumptive one, and with a good chunk of her own party potentially aggrieved. Publicly, Clinton’s aides are projecting a touch of nonchalance.“The month of March put us on a clear path towards the nomination, but the contests in New York and Pennsylvania have the potential to be even more decisive if Sanders fails to achieve significant victories there,” said Brian Fallon, Clinton’s spokesman. “We expect that by the end of April, it will be undeniable that Sanders has run out of scenarios to overtake Hillary Clinton’s delegate lead. It will be clear that she is going to the Democratic nominee.”Behind the poised facade, however, are real worries — or at least hurried attempts to find the right balance. Clinton’s talking points have grown far more specific to the general election in recent days. She has accused Donald Trump of being serially out of touch and has gone after Ted Cruz for being Trump’s temperamental clone.But the attacks have been undertaken with one eye firmly elsewhere. Sanders’ continued strength, and the slim but real chance that he gets a delegate tally allowing him to either win the nomination outright or persuade party insiders — the so-called superdelegates — to rethink their support of Clinton, makes him, basically, un-ignorable. So Clinton and her aides have kept at it, attacking Sanders with lines equal parts biting — “that he would place gun manufacturers’ rights and immunity from liability against the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook is just unimaginable to me,” she told MSNBC on Wednesday — and dismissive — “Senator Sanders had a good night last night,” she said of his Wisconsin win, “but if you look at the numbers, I am still considerably ahead.” The end result has been a weird, almost asymmetrical posture, with Clinton laying into a candidate that she simultaneously implies doesn’t have a chance. But it’s a tactic that campaign veterans say is unavoidable.“I think [the primary] really is effectively over, and I think the Clinton campaign has the dual problem of not taking the rest of the primary off and turning to the general,” said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist who, most famously, spearheaded Howard Dean’s presidential campaign in 2004. “Because once everyone thinks it is over, your opponent starts to win.”Trippi isn’t speaking theoretically here. There is evidence, perhaps anecdotal, that insurgent campaigns do better when elections seem to just about crystalize. Clinton rolled up a number of wins late in the 2008 primary. And in 1992, California Gov. Jerry Brown, for whom Trippi worked, chased down Bill Clinton as it seemed Clinton was taking a firm grasp of the nomination. The insurrectionist camp doesn’t want to give up, Trippi summarized, and the front-runner’s backers get complacent. Clinton’s allies aren’t uniformly nervous about this trend as the campaign enters what can be described as a transition period. In fact, they believe that part of their mission entails picking up the general election slack as the former secretary of state tries to shore up the primary. They are even leaving open the possibility of accelerating their plans if that primary drags on longer than anticipated.  “We have been preparing for both Trump and Cruz since the fall of 2015 and will increasingly highlight both of their records in the press, online and ultimately on television,” said Guy Cecil, who heads the Clinton-backing super PAC Priorities USA. “While we have already reserved our fall television buy, we haven’t ruled out going on the air prior to the convention.”But there is a distinction between a super PAC bearing the load and a campaign doing it. A campaign brings with it a more durable footprint: actual campaign staff doing actual campaign work, as opposed to television ad buys that, at this juncture, can have ephemeral effect. “It is what the campaign does that matters most,” said Plouffe. “It is not even close.”One element of the campaign that works in favor of Clinton and Sanders (should he end up winning the nomination) is that while things may remain in flux on the Democratic side, there is sustained chaos in the Republican race. The need to quickly define the opposition is lessened when it’s not exactly clear who the opposition will be — or, when the opposition is doing a counterproductive job defining itself. That, at least, was the point made by a former Democratic governor who knows a thing or two about how candidates can be defined in a presidential election.“I am more concerned about our collective ability to take advantage of what is an extraordinary opportunity not only to win the presidency, but to take back the Congress and lots of other offices as well,” said Michael Dukakis, who lost his run for president in 1988. “We can’t ‘pivot’ toward an opponent until we know who the Republican nominee is going to be, and that may take awhile.“I didn’t lose because I didn’t ‘pivot’ early enough. I lost because I made a decision not to respond to the Bush attack campaign, and in retrospect that was a pretty dumb decision.”You can’t wait till June 8 to start the general election. That would be a feat of epic political malpractice.While we have already reserved our fall television buy, we haven’t ruled out going on the air prior to the convention."
Most Voters Don’t Think Donald Trump Respects Women,1852,"More than 60 percent of voters don’t think that Donald Trump respects women, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey.During the 2014 midterms, the “war on women” became a partisan battle, pitting Democrats against Republicans. In this year’s presidential election, however, the problem seems limited quite specifically to Trump, who’s practically managed to make insulting women a plank of his campaign.A 62 percent majority of voters across both parties say that Trump isn’t respectful of women. In contrast, a third or fewer say the same of any other candidate, Republican or Democratic, who is still in the race.Female voters are actually less likely than male voters to see the four other candidates — Sanders, Clinton, Kasich and Cruz — as disrespectful of women, instead often saying they’re unsure. Trump, though, is an exception. Two-thirds of female voters, compared to 57 percent of men, see him as disrespectful.There’s a gender gap among GOP voters as well. While female Republican voters say by a 6-point margin that Trump is respectful of women, male GOP voters say the same by a far wider 20-point margin. In contrast, Republican men are not significantly more likely than Republican women to view Cruz and Kasich’s records in a good light.On the Democratic side, despite periodic accusations of sexism directed at Sanders by the Clinton camp, both candidates are seen as having regard for women. Just 4 percent of male Democratic voters and 3 percent of female Democratic say that Sanders doesn’t respect women. For Clinton, those numbers are 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively.Trump’s standing with women has earned extra scrutiny in recent weeks, after he argued for punishing patients who have abortions and attacked the looks of Cruz’s wife — the latter prompting a rare apology.It’s not clear that those specific events have done any harm to his image among women. As The Washington Post notes, Trump won the same percentage of the vote among both genders in Wisconsin, and there’s no sign his favorability rating has declined in the last few weeks among women nationally.The fact that these recent controversies don’t seem to have made much of an impact may show how much damage Trump incurred even before the most recent news cycle. Nearly half of female Republican voters say they can’t see themselves supporting Trump, and the candidate has even lower support among all female voters.“There was a sizable gender gap in Americans’ views of Trump as early as last July. But even as his overall image has worsened among both genders in recent months, the size of the gender gap has been fairly steady,” Gallup’s Frank Newport and Lydia Saad wrote at the beginning of the month. “[E]ven before these remarks, fewer than one in four women viewed him favorably, suggesting he may already be down to a core of rock-hard supporters whose opinions aren’t likely to change.” The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted April 1-3 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Ted Cruz Defends ‘New York Values’ Jab In Front Of Actual New Yorkers,513,"NEW YORK — As the 6 train rumbled above Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) made the case that some New Yorkers share his conservative positions and actually agree with his crack about “New York values.”“The people of New York know exactly what those values are,” Cruz said Wednesday afternoon at Sabrosura 2, a Chinese-Dominican restaurant where journalists clearly outnumbered the Texas senator’s supporters. “They’re the values of liberal Democratic politicians.”At a January debate in South Carolina, Cruz cited the “New York values“ of Donald Trump, his Queens-born, Manhattan-based rival. Such a person, Cruz said, is a social liberal who supports abortion rights and gay marriage.In a Republican primary campaign, that isn’t meant as a compliment. And though knocking New York as some kind of decadent coastal metropolis may play well in deep red states, Cruz’s line of attack is unlikely to find a very receptive audience among the New York voters he’s now courting.Trump currently has a commanding leading in his home state, but Cruz — fresh off Tuesday’s big win in Wisconsin — is hoping to gain enough support to diminish the front-runner’s chances of securing 1,237 delegates and the GOP nomination.On Wednesday, Cruz qualified his earlier statement by distinguishing between New Yorkers and New York’s Democratic politicians, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Rep. Charlie Rangel, former Rep. Anthony Weiner and former Gov. Eliot Spitzer.  “If you want to know what liberal democratic values are, follow Donald Trump’s checkbook,” Cruz said, noting that the Republican front-runner has given contributions to a number of Democratic politicians in the state. Cruz, an evangelical Christian, met with Hispanic and African-American pastors and several supporters behind a blue curtain on Wednesday as the press pack roamed the dining room, looking for members of the community to weigh in on the senator’s visit. Rev. Rubén Díaz Sr., a socially conservative Democrat and New York State senator, hosted the event for Cruz while his son, Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr., a socially liberal Democrat, introduced Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton at an event that morning in the Bronx. After the meeting with Díaz Sr. and other pastors, Cruz singled out de Blasio for criticism several times. He suggested that the mayor reflexively takes the side of “criminals and the looters and the rioters rather than the police officers.” And the senator said he cheered when members of the NYPD turned their backs on de Blasio last year. A couple of protesters disrupted Cruz’s event, saying they didn’t feel his values meshed with the community he was visiting.“Ted Cruz has no business being in the Bronx,” said a protester wearing a Yankees cap. “To receive this right-wing bigot is an insult to the whole community.”But Donald Sadler, who was also sporting a Yankees hat, told HuffPost that he’s a Cruz supporter and was glad to see the candidate visit the borough. Sadler, an African-American Bronx native who now lives about an hour north of the city, said he’s believed for years that “that Republicans need to come and mesh with the communities of New York.” Sadler said he knows what Cruz means by “New York values” — and agrees with him. “I understand clearly,” he said. “I’m pro-life. I’m pro-Second Amendment. I’m born and raised in New York City. I’m pro-family, traditional family, traditional marriage. These are our values. This is my value. This is not the general value of how voters in New York vote, and that’s what he said.”"
New York Primary Shaping Up To Be One Of The Most Important Contests Of The Election,1166,"The upcoming New York election may be one of the most consequential primaries to date, with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fighting to avoid embarrassing losses on their home territory. It’s the first time in modern history that the state has had two competitive primaries.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has now won seven of the last eight contests, although he still trails Clinton in delegates. For Democrats, New York’s April 19 primary will be the biggest prize to date with its 291 delegates. Sanders grew up in Brooklyn, although he’s spent his entire political career in Vermont. But it’s Clinton who is now most closely associated with the state; she was elected to two terms as its U.S. senator and has used that experience as part of her case for why she is best positioned to be president. Losing the state, even if it doesn’t hurt her significantly in the delegate count, would be a mighty symbolic blow. Clinton set her sights on New York even before the Wisconsin primaries were over, underscoring the importance of a win there and the reality that Sanders has been catching up in the polls. On Monday, she joined Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in New York City for a rally celebrating a new law raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour in much of the state. And on Tuesday, instead of finishing up campaigning in Wisconsin, she was back in New York appearing on “The View” on ABC, holding a women’s event in Brooklyn and attending a high-dollar fundraiser in the Bronx. She and former President Bill Clinton will also be campaigning in upstate New York, an area that tends to be more conservative but where she did better than expected during her Senate campaigns.Sanders, meanwhile, has set up a new office in Brooklyn. While he will be campaigning in other states over the next couple weeks, he’ll be returning to New York “most nights“ to focus on the race there, The Washington Post reports. Sanders also sat down with the New York Daily News editorial board for a wide-ranging interview. The resulting coverage likely wasn’t what he and his team wanted, with some criticism about his answers on both domestic and foreign policy. It also resulted in a tough Daily News front page.Still, Sanders has managed to significantly close the gap with Clinton in recent polling, and his April 13 rally in Washington Square Park is expected to have massive turnout. Sanders spokesman Karthik Ganapathy told Politico recently that the campaign felt good about New York because Sanders has “the wind at his back” after the string of wins. “New York is an opportunity for us to head into a state Secretary Clinton represented for years in the Senate, and continue connecting with voters by spreading Bernie’s message about the need for a political revolution that finally fixes a rigged economy and a corrupt system of campaign finance,” he said.Trump is on firmer ground in New York. He’s lived there his whole life and his golden, gaudy brand is inextricably tied to Manhattan. He’s also resonating in upstate New York, where his messages on trade and the economy have rung true with workers who have seen jobs disappear from the Rust Belt. His first congressional endorsement came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who represents the suburbs and rural areas outside of Buffalo. Trump has also passionately defended New York against his main opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has lambasted the real estate mogul’s “New York values.” “We don’t really like Cruz, and Donald is one of us,” John Catsimatidis, a billionaire talk radio host who owns the largest grocery store chain in Manhattan and ran for New York City mayor in 2013, told The Washington Post. “He’s a happy-go-lucky guy. He’s not seen as extreme. He’s seen as the guy who gets big things done and saves money when he does them.”Share this slide:"
"Obama, Biden Endorse Tammy Duckworth For Senate",5043,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) for Senate on Wednesday.“I’m proud to support Tammy Duckworth for the seat I once held in the United States Senate,” Obama said. “Few people fight as passionately for our veterans as Tammy. Soon after I was first elected president, I asked her to join my administration and serve her fellow veterans at the VA. She served with purpose and distinction — service that continued when she ran for Congress and won.  And I was proud to sign one of Tammy’s signature pieces of legislation — the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act — into law.”“When her nation calls, Tammy Duckworth answers, and I’m proud to support her in this next mission: running for the U.S. Senate,” Biden said. “She supports programs that make college more affordable, including free community college for deserving students, and that’s the kind of voice we need in the U.S. Senate.”The president rarely makes endorsements in congressional or Senate races, and it’s unusual that both he and Biden decided to publicly back Duckworth. Both are popular in Illinois — it is Obama’s home state, after all — so their support will go a long way. Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran and two-term congresswoman, is trying to unseat Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) in one of the most competitive races in the country. Polling from last summer showed Duckworth with a slight lead. She also raised more money in the last quarter of 2015 — $1.6 million to Kirk’s $1 million.There’s been some suspicious activity during their race. A “protest” last week at a Duckworth event included people who said they were being paid and didn’t know if the congresswoman was a Democrat or a Republican. In November, Kirk supporters were caught using a fake minimum wage petition to put his name on the ballot. The Kirk campaign denied any involvement.Share this slide:"
Hillary Clinton: ‘I’m Not Even Sure’ Bernie Is A Democrat,17376,"Hillary Clinton is running against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the Democratic nomination for president, but she’s not positive he belongs in the race. “He’s a relatively new Democrat,” the former Secretary of State told Politico. “In fact, I’m not even sure he is one. He’s running as one. So I don’t know quite how to characterize him.”Sanders, who has said he identifies as a socialist democrat, declared himself a Democrat last year when he announced his presidential campaign. Although he’s the longest-serving independent in congressional history, he caucuses with the Democrats and has served on and chaired committees for the party. He also has made key progressive issues like economic inequality central to his campaign.Many Democrats have endorsed the Vermont senator — but Clinton is not the first prominent one to question his loyalty to the party. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) tweeted in February that Sanders “is a Democrat ‘some days.’”At the time, Sanders responded to the criticism by saying, “of course I am a Democrat.”"
Chances Of A Contested Convention Jump After Ted Cruz’s Big Win In Wisconsin,988,"Donald Trump was having a rough week even before he got clobbered by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in Wisconsin’s primary on Tuesday. Prediction markets — which allow people to bet on what they think will happen — showed his chances of winning the nomination dropping over the last week. The chances of a contested Republican convention requiring two or more votes have climbed to 75 percent.PredictWise, which estimates these probabilities based on those prediction markets, shows that the likelihood of a contested convention has grown 14 percent in just a week. The likelihood of Trump winning the nomination has dropped by 19 percent in the same amount of time. Prediction markets react very quickly to events since they reflect constant buying and selling activity on prediction websites. They ask bettors to place wagers on what they think will actually happen — not what they would personally like to see happen or whom they would vote for, which is what polls ask. The way to make money in these markets is to bet on the event that ends up happening, and people change the way they allocate their money based on the current political context.Trump’s odds of winning the nomination dropped most dramatically after he lost the Iowa caucuses to Cruz in February. His numbers took a few weeks to recover, but he eventually regained that territory and at the end of the month had about an 81 percent chance of winning the nomination. His chances remained steadily in the 70s until last week. Wisconsin’s primary results changed bettors’ outlook on the convention by giving Cruz a big chunk of delegates that Trump badly needed in order to get to the 1,237 needed to win the nomination outright. According to FiveThirtyEight, Trump was already 6 percent behind the number of delegates he would need to be on track to win the nomination. The deficit in Wisconsin pushed him even farther behind.The likelihood of a contested convention of two or more ballots is directly related: If Trump fails to get to 1,237 delegates, the nomination remains up for grabs. He would have to convince enough delegates to vote for him in the first round of voting to make up the deficit — and there aren’t very many delegates not tied to a candidate in that first round. If no candidate gets the 1,237 majority in that vote, many of the delegates become free to vote for anyone. No one knows what would happen at that point.Until that point, the markets will continue to reflect the changing environment in the GOP primaries. If Trump wins in New York later this month, as polls suggest he will, his probability of winning the nomination will likely increase again — although it might not reach 70 percent since there will be less time left for Trump to collect delegates.For more information on prediction markets and the effects of Wisconsin’s primaries, see PredictWise founder David Rothschild’s blog post or the PredictWise website.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
Ben & Jerry: We’ve Been Trying To Get Taxed At A Higher Rate For Years,8328,"Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, known to most as the names behind the ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s, said they’d love to get taxed at a higher rate.“We’ve been trying to get taxed at a higher rate for years,” Cohen told HuffPost’s Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani in New York on Thursday.Cohen and Greenfield were giving out ice cream called “Bernie’s Yearning” at an event put on by Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders’ campaign. (Cohen and Greenfield attended as private citizens.)“Just because you happen to have a bunch of money doesn’t mean you should give up on the idea of justice and equality,” Cohen continued. The two have been vocal about their support for Sanders and his tax plan. They haven’t shied away from other political issues either, penning an op-ed against “tax cut nutters in Congress” in April 2015 and publicly putting their support behind the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011.Watch a clip of Cohen and Greenfield above.Share this slide:"
John Kasich Blames Black People For High Infant Mortality Rates After Cutting Program That Helped,10071,"Everyone knows Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) is running as the “nice guy” in the Republican presidential race. But at MSNBC’s recent GOP town hall, he made some nasty comments about black infant mortality rates in his state.After a question on criminal justice reform, NBC News host Chuck Todd asked Kasich to explain how his efforts in the black community could go further than policing and mass incarceration. Todd listed statistics including the state’s staggering income gap, that Ohio was deemed the sixth worst state to raise a black child by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and that Cleveland is considered one of the of the 10 most segregated cities in the U.S. Kasich, after saying he didn’t believe those statistics, listed his accomplishments as governor — including school reform and job creation — before oddly pivoting to infant mortality rates.  “The issue of infant mortality is a tough one. We have taken that on and one of the toughest areas to take on is in the minority community,” he said. “And the community itself is going to have to have a better partnership with all of us to begin to solve that problem with infant mortality in the minority community, because we’re making gains in the majority community.” Ohio has the third highest rate of infant mortality in the nation — and the main organization working to lower those rates had its funding cut by Kasich.Though Kasich expanded Medicaid, which brought health care to many low-income mothers, a lot of the gains were erased in February. That month he signed a bill to slash $1.3 million of state funding to Planned Parenthood and other organizations that “perform or promote” abortions (even though Ohio law already prevented state funds from covering abortions). The bill takes effect May 23. Among Planned Parenthood’s services is Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies, the largest of 14 infant mortality programs in the state. “It is offensive to hear John Kasich tell black women what we should do with our bodies, though not at all surprising. John Kasich blames black women for infant mortality, while as Governor, he cuts programs that help black families in Ohio,” said Alencia Johnson, assistant director of constituency communications for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund in a statement. “Kasich has created a web of policies that foster unsafe environments for black families,” Johnson said. “It is Kasich who continues to ignore the needs of Ohioans. The black community recognizes the truth — the problem is John Kasich.”The initiative focuses on reducing infant mortality rates in the black community. It routinely sends staffers to visit with black moms during their pregnancies and up until the child’s second birthday. “Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies” tackles hurdles common among at-risk moms by providing transportation to prenatal appointments and diapers, formula and other supplies. Over 2,800 new and expecting black mothers benefitted from the program in 2015. (Ohio Medicaid plans now attempt to do similar work by connecting pregnant women to “enhanced care management” and focusing resources on neighborhoods with high infant mortality rates, per the Kasich campaign.)Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the campaign, told The Huffington Post that because of the governor more than 300,000 women have access to health care in Ohio.“And I don’t know of a universe where 2,800 is a bigger number than 300,000,” he said.This piece has been updated to note Kasich’s work to expand Medicaid in Ohio."
Andrew Sullivan Returning To Cover Trump-Fueled 2016 Race Out Of ‘Civic Duty’,228,"NEW YORK — Andrew Sullivan, the veteran journalist and blogging innovator, is returning from a yearlong hiatus to write on politics and culture for New York magazine as a contributing editor. “With Donald Trump as the GOP front-runner, it seems to me a civic duty to get engaged with this election,” Sullivan wrote Friday to his “Dishheads” email list. “I’m sure you’re doing your bit; now it’s time for me to do mine.”An idiosyncratic conservative, Sullivan edited The New Republic in the mid-1990s before helping pioneer political blogging through his site, The Daily Dish. Sullivan later hosted the blog on the websites of Time, The Atlantic and The Daily Beast, while expanding along the way with additional writers and editors. He launched a subscription-based version of The Dish in 2013. Sullivan described having health problems when shuttering The Dish in January 2015, though he said they were not related to HIV, which he contracted two decades ago. His ailments, he said, resulted from “fifteen years of daily, hourly, always-on-deadline stress.”“The truth is, I had to stop primarily because it was killing me,” Sullivan said two months later. “I used to joke that if blogging does kill someone, I would be the first to find out.” In a September interview on MeaningofLife.tv, Sullivan described how he now meditates 30 minutes a day as part of his routine. “I changed my day, my habits, my life,” he said. Though Sullivan will blog for New York magazine during the Republican and Democratic conventions this summer, he promised not to take on that role again full time. “So am I going back to blogging? Nuh-huh,” he wrote. “The year off was revelatory. It’s only when you stop being pathologically attached to each ripple in the web-stream that you see most clearly how ephemeral so much of it is, how emotionally and nervously draining it can be, and how our discourse can be fatally distorted as well as deeply informed by the onslaught of the social web. I hope to write about what I learned in detox — it culminated in ten days of silent meditation last fall — soon.”Sullivan’s made a few TV appearances this past year, including on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and “Real Time with Bill Maher,” but has otherwise been absent from the political conversation surrounding a wild primary cycle.“I’d be lying if I told you there hadn’t been a few moments this year when I have had one hell of a blogging itch,” he wrote. He specifically mentioned “Obama’s long game as the liberal Reagan, the degeneracy of American conservatism, the Palin farce which paved the way for the Trump excrescence, the breakthrough with Iran, and the return of torture and grim advance of sponsored content.”Sullivan’s announcement follows Keith Olbermann recently announcing he was coming out of retirement to cover the 2016 race and writing Trump-related pieces for The Washington Post and Politico magazine. Olbermann, who led MSNBC’s shift to the left with his fiery political commentary, said he wouldn’t miss covering politics when returning in 2013 to ESPN, where he stayed for nearly two years. On Wednesday, Olbermann told Bill Simmons that he has been talking to networks, but even if he doesn’t return to television full time, he will be writing on the election.While the Trump-fueled craziness has helped spur Sullivan and Olbermann back into political writing and commentary, Jon Stewart doesn’t appear to be in a rush to return.   Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
The #NeverTrump Movement Could Have A Big Day In Wisconsin,1031,"Wisconsin’s GOP primary may be crucial for Republicans hoping to stop Donald Trump from clinching the nomination outright, with recent polling giving them hope that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could pull off a significant win. The state has 42 delegates up for grabs, with 24 awarded by district and 18 going to the statewide winner. Even if Cruz wins by a small margin, he’ll automatically take all 18 state delegates and likely a good portion of district level delegates. That would probably keep Trump below the level he needs to win a majority before the Republican convention.Of the six surveys taken of the race since March, all but one show Cruz ahead, with margins ranging between 1 and 10 points. Recent Marquette Law School and Fox News polls, both of which were conducted using live interviewers, each find Cruz with a relatively comfortable 10-point edge, up significantly from earlier in the year. Wisconsin’s demographics — light on evangelical voters, and heavy on those without a college degree — would seem to make it natural territory for Trump.But the frustration GOP voters feel elsewhere seems to be largely lacking in the state.“There certainly is a distrust of Wash­ing­ton, but there’s a real­iz­a­tion that Re­pub­lic­an lead­er­ship can work and can listen,” Matt Batzel, the ex­ec­ut­ive dir­ect­or of the con­ser­vat­ive Amer­ic­an Ma­jor­ity, told National Journal. “So Trump’s mes­sage of clean­ing house and try­ing to be a com­plete out­sider rings a little bit hol­low.”Candidates and groups opposing Trump have poured a combined $3.8 million into advertising in Wisconsin, according to the AP, in comparison to the approximately $430,000 spent by Trump’s campaign. Much of the state’s political leadership have also weighed in against Trump, as has local talk radio. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has repeatedly condemned the businessman’s rhetoric. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who’s overwhelmingly popular among Republican voters, threw his endorsement behind Cruz last week, and he is featured in TV ads for the Texas senator’s campaign.“I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall of this year,” Walker told Newsradio WTMJ, a Wisconsin station.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
"Cable News Is Getting Whiter, And The Timing Is Terrible",2543,"Melissa Harris-Perry was at 30 Rockefeller Center prepping for her MSNBC show last month when she witnessed the taping of an all-white panel of journalists and analysts discussing black voters in South Carolina.“It was jaw-dropping,” Harris-Perry said in a New York Times interview back in March. “Given that someone who wrote two books about the black vote was in the building.”Her experience, and her recent departure from MSNBC, is emblematic of a deeper problem in cable news: people of color not being included in conversations about people of color. Outside of MSNBC lies a whole cable news landscape that severely lacks inclusion, and the timing is terrible.In an election year where people of color account for 43 percent of eligible voters, where the Latino electorate alone will reach 27 million people, where white men make up a mere 31 percent of the American population, why is it that when the “black vote” and “Latino” are up for debate on TV, black and Latino voices are either tokenized, or worse — simply not there? Watch a mashup of discussions about the “black vote” on cable news below:MSNBC was thrown into controversy after it had a very messy and very public falling out with Harris-Perry last month. In a leaked email to her staff, she claimed that the network had tried to stifle her voice and authority. They pushed her away from conducting cultural discussions about race and identity and encouraged her to give a more straightforward analysis of the election, she said — something she had no interest in doing.“I am not a token, mammy or little brown bobble head,” Harris-Perry wrote. “I am not owned by... MSNBC.”The fallout from the whole episode prompted many to criticize not just MSNBC’s alleged unfair treatment of Harris-Perry, but the network’s lack of diversity overall. Since last year, the network has had a complete editorial overhaul, which meant the cancellation of most of its op-ed styles shows, including Ronan Farrow’s millennial-focused “Ronan Farrow Daily,” and Joy Reid’s “The Reid Report.”  But also among the shows axed were daily editorial news hours hosted by Alex Wagner, Touré, and Rev. Al Sharpton (whose show now only airs on Sundays), all moves that have prompted outcry and criticism. With Harris-Perry, Reid and Wagner gone, the only woman of color hosting a show on the network is Tamron Hall.Meanwhile, Cuban-American journalist Jose Diaz-Balart (who also anchors news hours on Telemundo and NBC), has seen his early-morning hour on MSNBC frequently-bumped to make room for election coverage and “Morning Joe.”Other than news anchors who report daily news, there are currently zero editorial or op-ed style shows (in the vein of Rachel Maddow or Bill O’Reilly) hosted by a person of color on the major cable news networks: MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News. And with Harris-Perry’s show gone, there are certainly far fewer diverse perspectives represented. “[Harris-Perry] gave so many people their first shot,” trans activist and Melissa Harris-Perry Show guest Cherno Biko told The Huffington Post. “She gave marginalized people a seat at the table.”A 2014 Media Matters study found that Harris-Perry’s show, compared to other Sunday shows including “Meet the Press” and “Fox News Sunday,” had the most diverse guests based on race and gender, with 27 percent white male guests and 73 percent of men and women of color.  2014 Media Matters Breakdown Of Sunday Shows Guests Based And Gender And Ethnicity:Here are some unsurprising, but alarming truths about the state of of cable news: A 2014 FAIR report found that 84 percent of cable news guests were white, the majority of them male. Last year, Vocativ researched not just the Sunday news shows, but all primetime and morning shows across the major networks, finding that people of color made up just 30 percent of all hosts and anchors (women of color were the least represented).  Beyond field reporters and contributors, there are only a handful of anchors or hosts of color on the major cable news networks: Tamron Hall, Craig Melvin, Jose Diaz-Albert, and Frances Rivera on MSNBC; Victor Blackwell, Michaela Pereira, Fredricka Whitfield and Don Lemon on CNN. CNN has also received criticism in the past for apparently phasing out black executives and prominent personalities including Suzanne Malveaux, Soledad O’Brien and TJ Holmes. The network, in a statement to The Huffington Post, CNN’s Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion Geraldine Moriba maintains that it is very committed to diversity and inclusion, saying, “We aim to provide different points of view and perspective in our news gathering and reporting.”Meanwhile, Fox News has three black anchors (Charles Payne, Arthel Neville and Harris Faulkner), two co-anchors (Kelly Wright and Charles Payne) but very few black contributors. A Media Matters annual “Sunday Shows” study revealed this year that 86 percent of guests on Fox News Sunday were white, and 63 percent were white men. We are in an election year, and we’re witnessing one of the most bizarre, frightening, fascinating, and important presidential races in recent memory. Discussions in particular about race have reached a boiling point — between the incidents of police brutality across the nation, the water crises in city’s like Flint, and the often incendiary racial and xenophobic comments of a certain Republican candidate, race is at the forefront of the country’s collective mind.Cable news is where many Americans go to unpack these issues. So what does it mean when, across the breadth of the cable news world, white anchors (be they on liberal or conservative networks) are bringing us that news, and shaping that conversation?While some networks make an effort to have at least one black or brown voice at the table, just as often the analysts, pundits, and hosts leading these discussions are white. The ramifications of this could be harmless, or they could be damaging. Take, for example, CNN’s 2015 coverage of the protests in Baltimore in the wake of the killing of Freddie Gray, where much of the emphasis of the coverage was on subtlety condemning the protestors as looters and thugs, rather than questioning why they were moved to protest in the first place. “Good journalism... tries to understand why a city is bleeding instead of just frowning at the wound,” Slate writer Justin Peters aptly observed. And in an election year where immigration is also a hot button topic, there is a dearth of Latino representation across the networks which has been the case for years.2015 Media Matters Breakdown Of Sunday Shows Guests Based And Gender And Ethnicity: “Diversity isn’t just about inviting minorities to discuss issues of race,” says Cherno Biko. “Our opinions should be included for topics that run the gamut.”There are some realities to acknowledge when it comes to this topic. First: the fact that MSNBC, a historically liberal network, saw its low ratings begin to perk up when it began focusing on the election and straightforward news and started phasing out its op-ed style shows (then again, it isn’t surprising that ratings would rise during an election year). Also, statistics show that cable news watchers are overwhelmingly white, male, and middle-aged to senior citizens. Do these viewers really care about diversity among their anchors? Are young, black and Latino voters really getting their news about the campaign from Fox, CNN, and MSNBC, or are they finding it on social media platforms? After all, a 2015 American Press Institute survey found that a whopping 88 percent of millennials say they get their news from Facebook. But for Yvette Miley, the Senior Vice President of Talent And Diversity at MSNBC, the aim of all networks should be to reach as diverse an array of viewers as possible. The network is keen to emphasize the fact that while they have no editorial shows hosted by people of color, they have ongoing relationships with people like Joy-Ann Reid, and a racially diverse roster of contributors. In addition to focusing on their pipeline programs and hiring people of color in positions of power behind-the-scenes (like Rashida Jones, the managing editor for MSNBC), Miley says that the network is addressing inclusion through other channels. “Diversity is an ongoing, everyday process,” she told The Huffington Post. “It is not a one and done. It is also dependent on the content. That’s also diversity. “Miley brings up a valid point — the concept of diversity, especially as it pertains to cable news, is not finite. The Melissa Harris-Perry’s of the world are equally as important as the Yvette Miley’s, as the Rashida Jones’. There are just 10 black-owned media stations in the United States, a fact that makes the dearth of black primetime anchors in news even less surprising. While MSNBC seems to be making a concerted effort to prove the #MSNBCsoWhite criticism wrong, it remains unclear whether other major networks share the same apparent passion for diversity.The problem of diversity in cable news, then, is a many-headed monster. Will more black guests across cable news fix the issue? Or more black anchors? Or more POC producers, vice presidents, and executive editors? At what point does representation become a non-issue in journalism? Should the race of who is leading conversations really affect the conversation itself? There are people behind-the-scenes who believe that the race of those having conversations about issues affecting black people is totally irrelevant — it’s journalism after all, and journalism isn’t about bias.On the other hand, studies have shown that racial bias in news media is an ongoing issue. That’s why perspective and context is an important aspect of even the most straightforward reporting. A white Fox News host who refuses to acknowledge race as a factor in the police killing of a black man, with no one there to vigorously challenge or even question him, is a perfect example of this.When talking about the need for more black hosts on cable news, one must return to the image of Melissa Harris-Perry listening to Steve Kornacki lead a vigorous debate with Kate Snow and Ari Melber about the “black vote.” Suddenly, the only question that seems worth asking is: how can race not be relevant? *As of publishing this article, Fox News has yet to comment. This post has been updated with a comment from CNN. Share this slide:“I am not a token, mammy or little brown bobble head.”“Diversity is an ongoing, everyday process. It is not a one and done.

Why Don’t Superdelegates Vote According To The Will Of Voters?,6525,"As I’ve previously noted on these pages, the Democratic Party’s tradition of permitting party elites to be “superdelegates” in their presidential primary process is a bad and undemocratic practice that should be thrown in the ashcan. After the superdelegates became a flashpoint for controversy and interparty animosity in 2008, the Democratic Party contemplated doing just that, but in the end declined to dismantle this scheme. And so it’s hardly surprising that now that the 2016 nomination race has become a compelling competition between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the superdelegate fiasco has returned anew.As you probably already know, there are 712 superdelegates, each of whom gets to cast a “vote” in the primary process that shows up in the overall delegate count, along with those delegates who are claimed according to the ballots cast in the states’ primaries and caucuses. Many of these 712 superdelegates are Democratic party poohbahs and DNC elites, but the lion’s share of the supers are simply elected officials — members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Others are tied to specific states by virtue of their functions within the Democratic Party.Bernie Sanders currently lags well behind Hillary Clinton in the race to claim superdelegates, a situation that has added to her advantage in the overall race to reach the magic number of delegates to claim the nomination. In recent weeks, Sanders supporters have started to make the case that the superdelegates who represent voters in states where Sanders has prevailed over Clinton should align their support with the way their constituents voted. At first blush, it’s a compelling argument. If superdelegates were to do so, it might limit Clinton’s advantage. (It would perhaps make life awkward for Sanders superdelegate Rep. Raul Grijalva [D-Ariz.], as Clinton won Arizona with 57.6 percent of the vote in that state’s primary.)Earlier this week, it was reported that a Sanders supporter from Eagle River, Alaska, named Levi Younger took to Facebook to challenge one of his state’s superdelegates — Alaska Democratic party national committeewoman Kim Metcalfe — to follow the will of Alaskans who voted for Sanders in a blowout win in the Alaska caucus. Metcalfe responded, at times impertinently, and Younger leaked the conversation.U.S. Uncut’s Tom Cahill has documented the full blow-by-blow here. The essential part of the conversation, however, begins with Metcalfe supplying her reasoning for supporting Clinton in the face of the Alaska caucus results:METCALFE: Because I believe Hillary Clinton would be a better president. End of conversation.YOUNGER: And that’s why people get angry. Bernie supporters can be quite vapid. But voting in opposition to what we voted for is only supporting the idea that Hillary and her supporting super delegates are in the pockets of others. Bernie won in Alaska. End of story. Your personal preferences for president are represented in your vote as a citizen. Not as a representative of your state.Metcalfe would go on to push back on Younger’s claim: “I’m in the pocket of no one. I have no financial connections to Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat. I am a retired union representative. I put in my time in the trenches for 40 years, and I really object to someone like you who has probably done nothing except caucus telling me what to do. I am voting for the best interests of my country. And that would be Hillary Clinton.”I can’t speak to whether Metcalfe is being disingenuous here, but for the sake of argument, I’m going to assume that she came to her decision with the same honest agency as the aforementioned Grijalva. I’ll do that for two reasons: first, because this is part of my brief against superdelegates — the system itself gives rise to suspicion (and that suspicion is perhaps warranted). But more importantly, when Metcalfe is using her agency to offer her superdelegate support against the will of her state’s voters, she is doing precisely what the Democratic Party intended the superdelegates to do. Here’s DNC Rules Committee co-chair James Roosevelt Jr. explaining in 2010 why the DNC opted to retain the superdelegates (emphasis mine):“People ask: isn’t it enough for folks to have floor privileges and a hotel room and not have an actual vote?” says rules-committee co-chair James Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. “The answer is: what you’re doing is creating two classes of delegates, people with the vote and people without the vote. Clearly, the people at the grassroots level should be the predominant voice. But if you don’t give elected officials a real voice, they are basically second-class citizens.”This is how the Democratic Party conceives of the superdelegates — they would be “second-class citizens” if they did not have this ability to have a voice equal to “people at the grassroots level,” and potentially break against them. I am not personally endorsing any of this (it’s ridiculous), I’m merely pointing out that this is the world as it is.The truth of the matter is that many of the superdelegates actually prefer to use their special powers to do precisely what Levi Younger and others would prefer them to do — support a candidate in concert with the consensus of primary voters. As Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) put it in 2008, many superdelegates are simply guided by “timing...preferring to make their decision public after the primaries are over.” McCaskill went on to make clear that exposure to this sort of controversy is something that many superdelegates would prefer to avoid: “They would like someone else [i.e. the primary voters] to act for them before they talk about it in the cold light of day.”Of course, the fact that many superdelegates might be happy to break in support of the voters’ will at the last second does not — at the moment — help Sanders either. Unless he starts winning more primary contests by larger margins, he’ll be caught between the actions of the bold superdelegates and the reticence of the timid superdelegates.It’s worth pointing out that Sanders could do a lot more to help the cause of persuading superdelegates than he is currently doing. One of the traditional responsibilities of a presidential nominee is to be a party standard-bearer, and to lend all manner of support to the party’s efforts in downticket races. This includes such things as helping to organize the party’s efforts, lending legislators’ campaigns support in the form of voter data and fundraising, and openly campaigning in important districts alongside others who are up for election.The Clinton campaign has long made it clear that they were going to make a massive effort to lend this kind of support to downticket organizing and party-building. Sanders, not so much. As recently as this week, when asked about whether he’d provide support to other Democrats and put his fearsome small-dollar fundraising machine to the service of winning legislative elections, Sanders demurred, saying, “We’ll see.” So, imagine if you are a Democratic Party superdelegate and there’s one candidate who’s laid out a plan to provide this sort of support and one who is, for some reason, withholding it. Who are you likely to back? The campaign that’s had “joint fundraising agreements with 33 state Democratic parties“ in place since September of last year, or the campaign that’s saying, “I don’t know, we’ll see about whether or not that’s something we do.”Of course, this is about far more than simply forming a mutual backscratching society. If Bernie Sanders harbors any hope for successfully implementing even some of his agenda, he will need — at a minimum! — Congressional majorities to pull it off. This is the sort of thing that needs to be a central concern of his campaign, not an afterthought.None of this makes the superdelegate super-structure a worthy thing to continue, but for this primary season, it will remain in place. So if he wants superdelegates to support him, he needs to come up with some answers.Over the course of many months, the Sanders campaign and his supporters have shifted from critiquing the superdelegates as a semi-corrupt and elitist practice, to mounting a belated charm-slash-aggro offensive to cajole their support. Sanders and his supporters were right in the first place! Alas, now they need to win a primary.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
Bernie Sanders Shows Off His T-Shirt Cannon Skills,2781,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was the “mystery guest” on Thursday’s episode of “The Late Show,” packing a lot into his 4-minute surprise appearance.Sanders and host Stephen Colbert chatted about superdelegates, with the presidential hopeful arguing that they “should listen to the will of the people” and vote for him against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Some superdelgates in New York have said they will vote for Clinton no matter who wins the state’s primary election on April 19, according to the New York Daily News.Sanders also “saved” an employee hiding behind Colbert’s desk during his appearance, and showed off his skills with a t-shirt cannon.Check out a clip of his appearance (starting at 5:15) above.Share this slide:"
Insurgent Democratic Candidate Ups Ante In Call For Debbie Wasserman Schultz To Resign,7523,"WASHINGTON — Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s (D-Fla.) support for payday lenders has been earning her some enemies on the left, and she can add one more to the list: the insurgent Democratic candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania.John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, recently called for Wasserman Schultz to resign, and doubled down on that call Thursday in an interview with a local news station, accusing his party’s leader of colluding with payday lenders.Wasserman Schultz sparked the ire of the left when she co-sponsored legislation to undercut forthcoming payday loan reforms from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She’s also been criticized by her own Democratic primary opponent for taking campaign contributions from the loan industry.Asked by WTAE’s Jackie Cain if his opposition to the party’s chairwoman was “a bold move,” Fetterman, a decidedly non-traditional politician, said it was more a matter of common decency.“I wouldn’t call it a bold move. I would call it an appropriate one given her collusion with the sub-prime, payday loan, lending machine,” Fetterman said. “I can’t imagine — the average interest rate they charge is 309 percent — as a Democrat, how could you get in bed with those kind of people?”He also pointed to her campaign’s donors.“The fact that she would take tens of thousands of dollars from that industry, and the fact that she would try to pass legislation that benefits that industry — it’s deeply disappointing particularly for the head of the DNC,” Fetterman said.The DNC’s press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but Wasserman Schultz’s campaign told HuffPost last month that she was looking out for Florida, and thought Florida’s payday loan law was a good one.“As a state lawmaker, she helped write Florida’s law that has sharply reduced the need to go to bad actors, curbed predatory practices and created standards and protections for low-income borrowers,” spokesman Sean Bartlett said in a statement. “The Congresswoman wants to work with the CFPB on the way forward, and believes the Florida law is an example of how to achieve their shared goals of balancing strong consumer protections with preserving access to credit in underserved communities.”Fetterman is not well-known in most of Pennsylvania, and is currently third in most polls for the seat’s Democratic primary, trailing former Rep. Joe Sestak as well as the faltering Democratic Party-endorsed candidate, Katie McGinty, a former aide to Gov. Tom Wolf. Fetterman still sees a chance, however, because few Pennsylvania voters say their minds are made up.Watch Fetterman’s comments on Wasserman Schultz below, and the full interview on WTAE.Share this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Voters Are Giving More Thought Than Ever To This Election,1085,"Voters’ interest in the presidential race is at a record level. Donald Trump could divide the Republican Party. And the Wisconsin primary is looking good for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders while the New York primary favors Trump and Hillary Clinton. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 1, 2016. ATTENTION TO THE ELECTION REACHES AN ALL-TIME HIGH - Pew Research: “Fully 85% of registered voters say they have given a lot of thought to the 2016 election. That is not only greater interest than at comparable points in recent campaigns, it is the highest level of interest measured at any point in all elections since 1988. Fully 89% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say they are giving a lot of thought to the election, compared with 82% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. At this stage in the 2012 campaign, when only the GOP had a contested nomination, 71% of Republicans and 64% of Democrats said they were giving a lot of thought to the election.” [Pew]The only comparable election was 2008 - Eight years ago, when both parties had competitive primaries, 78 percent of voters were paying serious attention to the election.. In the spring of 2000, less than half of voters had given the election a lot of thought, despite nomination contests for both parties. CLINTON AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY- HuffPollster: “Supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton...differ most notably on whether life is improving or getting worse for people like them.There’s a significant gap just between the two parties, with Republicans 38 points more likely than Democrats to say things are getting worse. But the gulf is even wider between Trump supporters, who are the most pessimistic, and Clinton supporters, who are the most personally optimistic...Not coincidentally, disaffection with society’s direction is most pronounced among the demographic groups where Trump holds the most appeal. A 54 percent majority of white voters believe life is getting worse for people like them, as do 60 percent of whites who haven’t completed college. In contrast, black voters, who have formed the base of Clinton’s support in many primaries, have the sunniest outlook of any demographic group, with 58 percent saying that things have improved.” [HuffPost]TRUMP WOULD BE A HISTORICALLY UNPOPULAR NOMINEE- HuffPollster: “If he wins the GOP nomination, Trump wouldn’t be the first nominee to enter a general election with negative ratings. He would, however, be the least popular major party nominee in modern times.....The American public’s view of Trump, which improved briefly after he entered the race, seems to be worsening...Conventional wisdom holds that there’s little room for a well-known, disliked candidate to improve. But Trump has defied conventional wisdom before…. if Trump is chosen as the nominee, he may well see another boost as recalcitrant GOP voters ultimately decide to rally around him, giving him a version of the post-convention bounce candidates traditionally receive….But for Trump to turn around his historically low ratings at this point would require a historically sized shift. “ [HuffPost] A Trump nomination could divide the party - Pew Research: “GOP voters also are skeptical that the party will unite behind Trump if he is the party’s nominee. Just 38% say the party would ‘unite solidly’ behind Trump, while 56% say disagreements within the party would keep many Republicans from supporting him. That is much lower than the share of Republican voters who expected the party to unite behind Mitt Romney (65%) and John McCain (64%) at comparable points in the 2012 and 2008 nomination campaigns. By contrast, most Democratic voters (64%) think their party will solidly unite behind Clinton if she is the nominee. In March 2008, about as many Democrats (66%) said the party would unite behind Barack Obama if he won the Democratic nomination. [Pew] CRUZ AND SANDERS LEAD IN WISCONSIN - Dana Blanton: “[Ted] Cruz garners 42 percent among Wisconsin likely GOP primary voters, while Trump receives 32 percent. John Kasich comes in third with 19 percent…. There is a big gender gap.  Women back Cruz over Trump by a 19-point margin (46-27 percent).  The two candidates are much closer among men:  Cruz gets 40 percent to Trump’s 35 percent. Cruz’s advantage over the real estate mogul also comes from self-described ‘very’ conservative voters, who give him a 36-point lead...Bernie Sanders is ahead of Hillary Clinton by a 48-43 percent margin in the race for the Democratic nomination in Wisconsin….Sanders owes his advantage — which is within the poll’s margin of error — to young voters and men” [Fox results for Republicans, Fox results for Democrats]  TRUMP AND CLINTON HAVE BIG LEADS IN NEW YORK - Quinnipiac University:  “[Hillary] Clinton tops Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont 54 – 42 percent while [Donald] Trump leads among Republicans with 56 percent, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 20 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 19 percent….New York remains solidly blue as either Clinton or Sanders top any Republican in the head-to-head general election matchups….In New York State’s GOP primary, men go 63 percent for Trump, 18 percent for Kasich and 16 percent for Cruz. Women go 48 percent for Trump, 25 percent for Cruz and 21 percent for Kasich….There are gender and racial gaps in the Democratic primary as women pick Clinton over Sanders 59 – 37 percent, while men go 49 percent for Sanders and 46 percent for Clinton...The gender gap carries into the Clinton-Trump matchup as women back Clinton 60 – 27 percent while men go 45 percent for Clinton and 41 percent for Trump.” [Quinnipiac] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Hillary Clinton Tries To Remind New Yorkers How Much They Liked Her As Senator,2153,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton kicks off her campaigning in upstate New York Friday, as she attempts to hold on to the state she represented as a U.S. senator for eight years ahead of its primary elections in two weeks.Clinton will host a roundtable discussion on manufacturing and small business jobs in Syracuse Friday morning, before attending a rally in the afternoon. Policy adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday to expect “extensive” campaigning by Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and said specific places they’ll visit will be announced in the coming days.Upstate New York is not an area that usually gets much attention during a presidential campaign. Places like Potsdam, Canton and Little Falls all received mentions on a Clinton campaign press call Thursday evening, as aides hammer the message that Clinton likes New York, and New Yorkers liked her, too. “The next two weeks are going to be a pretty exciting time from her perspective ... a time when she gets to reconnect with people she’s worked very closely with,” Sullivan said. The press call felt more like something for a Senate campaign than a presidential campaign — and that was the point. Former staffers and upstate New York supporters talked about her work on agriculture, job fairs for college students, manufacturing and local economic initiatives.It was that sort of personal, constituent-focused outreach that won over a skeptical state when she ran for Senate in 2000 and tried to shed a carpetbagger image. She famously launched a “listening tour” that took her to all 62 counties in New York. (The Wall Street Journal said she “bounced around upstate New York like a FedEx delivery truck run amok.”) Back then, many voters were surprised that she was putting in the work to learn about all corners of the state. “No candidate ever, ever comes here. Ever. Ever,” Barbara Steinwachs, a resident of Penn Yan, a village of just over 5,000 people, told the New York Times at the time. “People are thrilled. And to have it to be the first lady makes it even more thrilling. I think people are impressed just that she came.” Clinton ended up winning over many upstate New York voters, depriving her Republican opponent of the votes he needed to beat her in the part of the state that is traditionally more conservative. And during her tenure as senator from 2001-2009, she remained popular. Rather than coming into the Senate and making a big splash, she kept her head down and focused on issues of concern to New York — and that’s the record that she and her campaign will try to invoke in advance of the April 19 primary.“[Sanders] is going to campaign like a Brooklynite, and she’s going to campaign like a senator who represented this state for eight years and has lived here for 16,” Joel Benenson, Clinton’s top strategist, told reporters Monday.“She is going to be making a larger case here,” Sullivan added Thursday. “And that larger case is built on the proposition that she believes she is the only candidate in the race on either side who can actually set forth a vision for where she wants to take this country and prove to people that she can get there — that she can actually deliver that outcome and make that difference in people’s lives that is going to improve things for them.”But Sanders isn’t going to give up New York without a fight. He was born in Brooklyn, and the state has a strong base of progressives who are drawn to his message. The Sanders campaign also believes that his economic message could resonate with the voters who have seen jobs disappear in the state. In recent days, Sanders has cut steadily into Clinton’s lead.Losing New York would be a major blow to Clinton symbolically, even if it doesn’t significantly hurt her in her delegate lead against Sanders. The state, which is solidly Democratic in presidential elections, could also take on outsized importance in the general election if Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination. The New York native’s first congressional endorsement came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who represents a district encompassing the suburbs and rural areas outside Buffalo. Trump currently has a sizable lead in the state ahead of the GOP primary this month.  Enter your email address:Share this slide:"
Donald Trump’s Ratings Are Historically Awful,5255,"Give Donald Trump credit: his candidacy may be unifying the country over dislike for him.At this point, it might be easier to run down the list of demographic blocs Trump hasn’t alienated. He’s disliked by Democrats and independents, by young voters, and by minorities, not to mention even the female voters in his own party.If he wins the GOP nomination, Trump wouldn’t be the first nominee to enter a general election with negative ratings. He would, however, be the least popular major party nominee in modern times. The only recent candidate with comparably low ratings is former KKK leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination in 1992.“In terms of any domestic personality that we have measured, we’ve never seen an individual with a higher negative,” Democratic pollster Peter Hart told The Washington Post, calling Trump’s image “exceptionally rancid.”The American public’s view of Trump, which improved briefly after he entered the race, seems to be worsening.  HuffPost Pollster, which averages all publicly available polling, currently gives him a 63 percent unfavorable rating, up from 56 percent in January.His decline has been especially steep among women, who have soured on him dramatically since the beginning of the year. Conventional wisdom holds that there’s little room for a well-known, disliked candidate to improve. But Trump has defied conventional wisdom before.When he first announced his candidacy last June, Trump’s image among Republicans was also inauspiciously, and historically, bad. An analysis from FiveThirtyEight, which declared that “Trump is the first candidate in modern presidential primary history to begin the campaign with a majority of his own party disliking him,” put Trump’s unfavorable rating among the GOP at about 57 percent — close to his current numbers among the populace as a whole today.Once it became clear, however, that Trump was intending a serious candidacy, his favorability among Republicans rose quickly and dramatically into positive territory. Although he remains considerably more divisive within his party than past front-runners, his ratings among the GOP have since remained generally stable. And if Trump is chosen as the nominee, he may well see another boost as recalcitrant GOP voters ultimately decide to rally around him, giving him a version of the post-convention bounce candidates traditionally receive.“Should Trump be the nominee, a lot of Republicans who have a hard time believing they would actually vote for him ... they may turn,” GOP pollster Neil Newhouse told Politico.It’s also not out of the range of possibility that Trump could improve his image among voters outside his party, pivoting away from his most extreme proposals to focus on a more broadly appealing message around economic populism.As The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker and Robert Costa wrote Thursday:[Trump and his advisers] say he can reverse his favorability ratings over time by framing the fall contest around issues on which they believe Trump’s positions resonate powerfully across traditional demographics: the economy, trade and national security.Since Trump is not tethered to any particular ideology, his test may be convincing voters that he is not a hostile force and is fit to be president, rather than persuading them to buy into a sweeping conservative ideological project.But for Trump to turn around his historically low ratings at this point would require a historically sized shift. One of the biggest general election improvements in modern history, according to Gallup’s Andrew Dugan, belonged to Bill Clinton. During the 1992 election, Clinton managed to swing a staggering 18-point change in his net favorability rating in 1992, going from a -8 in July to +10 before his election. A similar change would still leave Trump at a remarkably bad net -13.That’s likely a relief to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, whose campaign otherwise might be facing more painful questions about her own less-than-glowing ratings. Clinton’s net favorability, which is at its lowest point since 2009, currently stands at -14, making her, if not as abhorred as Trump, still widely disliked.While Trump is the most extreme example, he has company: in a shift from past elections, nearly the entire presidential field this cycle has been notably unpopular.“I think everyone is getting painted with [a negative] brush because the political discourse is so unsatisfactory,” Republican pollster David Winston told NPR last year. “That’s the challenge to the candidates on both sides — how do they turn this discourse into something that is actually meaningful for the electorate.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
Donald Trump Accidentally Articulates GOP Abortion Stance A Little Too Loudly,1361,"So, that happened. Republican front-runner and caramelized Weisswurst Donald Trump famously has been all over the map with his position on reproductive rights, but this week he managed to sail straight into “here be dragons” territory. During an interview with Chris Matthews of “Hardball,” he suggested that women should face legal sanctions for having abortions. “There has to be some form of punishment,” Trump said, clarifying after later questioning that he was referring to the procedure’s recipient. We lead off this week’s “So That Happened” with a discussion of Trump’s “gaffe.”It was maybe the only thing a candidate could say about abortion to get both defenders of reproductive freedom and their antagonists angry, and condemnation from both sides was so swift that it managed to knock Trump a-kilter. But lost in the ensuing controversy and Trump campaign walk-backs was an essential truth: Trump was just “saying bluntly what the actual implications of longstanding Republican policies” on abortion are, co-host Zach Carter argues. Also lost: In many ways, Trump is the moderate candidate in the GOP race when it comes to reproductive rights. Also on this week’s podcast: Documents obtained by Fairfax Media, The Huffington Post’s media partner in Australia, have revealed energy contractor Unaoil as an almost comical practitioner of corporate graft, bribing its way across the developing world on behalf of well-known Western corporations. The documents expose many companies to prosecution, but they also uncover the twisted nexus of corporate corruption, failed states and global terrorism. We’ll break down the story.And in some better news for major U.S. corporations, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) defied his party this week by vetoing a religious freedom bill that would have enshrined legal discrimination against the LGBTQ community. We have Disney and the NFL, among others, to thank for this, proving once again that cash rules everything around us.Finally, what is it like to fall into the burning ring of fire produced by Trump’s legion of social media fans? Our own Christina Wilkie found out for herself, and has some of the vile details to share with us.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney.

Massive Anti-Trump Banner Goes Up On Mexico’s Senate Building,2765,"Just a few days after effigies of Donald Trump were burnt all over Mexico as part of an Easter ritual, the nation’s senators expressed their own anti-Trump thoughts by hanging a large banner outside the Senate building in Mexico City with the hashtag “MxContraTrump.”The GOP presidential front-runner angered many Mexican citizens when he demanded that a wall be built between their country and the U.S. — and that Mexico pay for it. In an expletive-laden interview with Fusion, former Mexican President Vicente Fox said that he was “not going to pay for that f*cking wall.”And now, it seems like his fellow politicians share a similar sentiment.Learn more in the video above.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
Top Black Staffers Leave The Republican National Committee,5839,"The Republican National Committee is losing the person who leads the GOP’s outreach to black communities, as first reported by NBC News and confirmed by The Huffington Post.  Kristal Quarker-Hartsfield, the national director of African-American Initiatives at the RNC, is leaving the organization to work for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) as his director of intergovernmental affairs. Her last day is set to be Friday, and she is the second black top staffer to depart the RNC this month.Quarker-Hartsfield joins several other staffers of color who have departed the RNC recently. Orlando Watson, communications director for black media, left earlier this month. Tara Wall and Raffi Williams, son of Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, both left their press positions at the RNC late last year. RNC Chair Reince Priebus has said that expanding the party and reaching out to groups of people who don’t usually vote Republican are priorities. After the 2012 elections, he famously released an autopsy report concluding that the GOP needed to broaden its base if it wanted to survive a changing country. “The RNC cannot and will not write off any demographic or community or region of this country,” Priebus said at the time.But the GOP’s presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, threatens to upend much of that work with his incendiary comments about women, immigrants, protesters and Muslims that appall many members of his own party.Asked about her decision to depart, Quarker-Hartsfield told HuffPost, “I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the RNC. It has been an honor to work for Chairman Priebus during an exciting time in politics. It has been exciting to have a front row seat to a national Republican movement to maintain the House and win back the Senate. Chairman Priebus is an innovative leader who empowers his team, and serves my Party as a humble servant leader.”Williams denied that he left the RNC because of Trump.“I left because I was just ready for something new. They were good to me, they treated me very well and I have no complaints about the place,” he told HuffPost. “I think it’s a part of the natural cycle of the RNC. People come and go.”A recent USA Today poll showed that if Trump faces off against Democrat Hillary Clinton in November, voters of color would overwhelmingly reject the business mogul. Black voters were the most pronounced, backing Clinton 67 percent of the time.This story has been updated with comment from Kristal Quarker-Hartsfield.Share this slide:"
Anthony Weiner Thinks Donald Trump Is As Doomed As He Was,1062,"Former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) is pretty sanguine about the Democratic Party’s chances in a general election should Donald Trump become the Republican Party’s nominee. Unlike the labor wing of the party, which worries about Trump’s appeal to working-class white voters, and operatives who fear a scorched-earth campaign, Weiner says the real estate tycoon’s inherent flaws will ultimately doom his candidacy. Put simply, Trump’s campaign reminds Weiner of his own race for mayor of New York City in 2013.“Donald Trump, if he’s the nominee, with 65 percent negatives, is not going to be our president,” Weiner said. “I just know that that’s the case. I had that problem.”In the latest episode of our “Candidate Confessional” podcast, Weiner twice drew parallels between Trump’s campaign and his own.   In 2013, Weiner entered his primary in a similar position to Trump: He was a flawed candidate who benefited from running in a crowded field. “When you’re in a five-way race, having 40 percent negatives is not disqualifying. ... [as] Donald Trump will attest,” he said. So far, Trump has largely overcome moments when it seemed like his candidacy would implode. He’s managed to win races even as the Republican field has thinned out. But a clean delegate win still isn’t a sure bet, and the party is belatedly consolidating around Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).  Weiner, who was ultimately undone after news surfaced that he’d sent more explicit texts than he’d previously acknowledged, believes that reality will catch up with Trump. There was no massive negative ad blitz at the end of Weiner’s mayoral campaign — at that point, he was too far down in the polls to matter. But Weiner can easily envision one that targets Trump, because like Weiner, he provides easy targets. That ad campaign, Weiner imagines, would be crippling.  “It’s funny, I hadn’t thought till right this moment about how many Trump parallels there are to [my] race,” Weiner said. “This is the second time his race has come up. It’s kind of instructive.”Share this slide:"
Hillary Clinton Takes A Stand Against ‘Subminimum Wage’ For People With Disabilities,6270,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton expressed support for eliminating the “subminimum wage” for people with disabilities employed in specialized workplaces, a major coup for disability rights advocates who argue that the little-known loophole is discriminatory and harmful.The subject came up Monday in a question-and-answer session at a campaign event at the University of Wisconsin — Madison. An attorney in the audience, who described herself as being on the autistic spectrum, asked Clinton about the lower minimum wage for workers with disabilities at employers like Goodwill Industries and how she would “create jobs for the disabled population.”“When it comes to jobs, we’ve got to figure out how we get the minimum wage up and include people with disabilities in the minimum wage,” Clinton responded. “There should not be a tiered wage.”That extends beyond people with disabilities, Clinton said, and includes the minimum wage exemption for tipped workers, typically in the food service industry. The federal minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour. While employers are required to top it off if tips do not bring hourly pay to $7.25, that has proven difficult to enforce.“So I want us to take a hard look at raising the minimum wage and ending the tiered minimum wages, whether it’s for people with disabilities or the tipped wage,” Clinton said. “You’ve got millions of people that are totally dependent on tips that may or may not make up a minimum wage, let alone beyond.”Clinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. Her campaign didn’t respond to a question asking whether she would extend that minimum to workers with disabilities and to those whose pay includes tips. While Clinton’s endorsement of ending the tipped minimum wage is notable, her support for lifting the exemption that applies to workers with disabilities made greater waves because it addresses a priority of disability rights advocates rarely discussed on the national stage.Ari Ne’eman, a co-founder of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, one of 81 disability rights groups opposed to the practice of paying workers who have disabilities a lower minimum wage, applauded Clinton’s remarks as “game-changing.”“To see a major presidential candidate take a stance on this is a very significant step,” Ne’eman said. “We call on other candidates in the race to match Secretary Clinton’s commitment.”Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind, thanked Clinton in a statement “for stating boldly and unequivocally that she rejects the discriminatory practice of paying workers with disabilities subminimum wages.”Clinton would do away with the practice of paying a subminimum wage for workers with disabilities, which dates to the 1938 law that created the first federal minimum wage.The provision allows employers recognized by the federal government for hiring workers “whose earning or productive capacity is impaired” by a mental, physical or developmental disability to pay workers based on individual productivity, according to the Department of Labor, even if it is less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. There is no legally mandated wage floor for people with disabilities employed in such circumstances; it is at the eligible employer’s discretion.The law was intended to encourage employers to hire people with disabilities, since they might otherwise lack the incentive to do so. People with disabilities, the thinking went, might then develop skills that would allow them to move into jobs where the regular minimum wage applied.Today, however, the subminimum wage allowance is more likely to lead to exploitation and isolation for people with disabilities than to independence and dignity, advocates say.“It is a relic — it reflects a 1930s set of assumptions about people with disabilities,” Ne’eman said.There were 228,600 workers with disabilities earning a subminimum wage in fiscal 2013, according to the Department of Labor.The vast majority of those workers with disabilities toil in what are known as “sheltered workshops”: mainly nonprofit institutions that have built their business model on meeting federal guidelines for the subminimum wage — and that employ those workers exclusively. These employers typically become certified as job-training service providers for people with disabilities as well, enabling them to pick up added revenue through Medicaid reimbursements.But that revenue rarely gets passed onto the disabled workers in sheltered workshops.In fact, the workers sometimes earn wages that would embarrass even some sweatshop owners in the developing world. A June 2013 investigation by NBC News found that Goodwill Industries, one of the country’s largest sheltered workshops, paid workers in some states as little as 22 cents an hour as its executives reaped six-figure salaries.Rose Sloan, a government affairs specialist for the National Federation for the Blind, said she has seen certification forms from the Department of Labor showing that some employers pay these workers “pennies” per hour.According to a 2001 Government Accountability Office study, just 5 percent of workers employed in sheltered workshops went on to find jobs in the mainstream economy. Ne’eman attributed the poor results to the isolation of workplaces that wall off workers with disabilities, and to employers that invest minimal resources in training. Ne’eman maintained that people with disabilities would be as productive as anybody else if given the same job training, work environment, and access to effective support services. The Department of Justice is encouraging states to adopt this egalitarian, integrated workplace model by cracking down on sheltered workshops that do not meet training requirements. And it may be catching on. Maryland passed a bill earlier this month abolishing the subminimum wage for people with disabilities.“Performance can be equal, given the proper training and proper support services, and what we have seen is that states that have moved away from subminimum wage and sheltered workshops” have had success, Ne’eman said.Share this slide:When it comes to jobs, we’ve got to figure out how we get the minimum wage up and include people with disabilities in the minimum wage.To see a major presidential candidate take a stance on this is a very significant step."
"The Sanders-Clinton Debate Flap, Explained",1816,"In the primary season thus far, the Democratic candidates have debated on nine occasions, some of which — the ones not scheduled on weekends, or holidays, or staged within Schrodinger’s Box — you may have seen. There could be two more, one in April and one in May, but they’re pending.Bernie Sanders would very much like to debate Hillary Clinton in New York before that state’s April 19 primary. Clinton, on the other hand, would prefer not to. But the Clinton campaign bungled its refusal, turning the situation into a Thing that has drawn criticism from all directions. So before we get too far down the Thinkpiece Road, let’s demystify all of this with a little real talk.During the primary season, the debate schedule is mostly decided by party elites who like to wrest control over the primary process and keep it from going off the rails. The efforts exerted by the GOP, in this regard, made a small amount of news last year. On the Democratic side, the decisions made about the debates have mostly centered on the aforementioned odd scheduling of those events and a follow-on critique from some in the Democratic Party that the debate schedule was largely designed to benefit Hillary Clinton, the party’s leading institutional choice for the nomination.That critique is absolutely true, by the way. Nevertheless, it is arguable that there have now been an adequate number of debates to discern the philosophical and policy differences between the two Democratic candidates. So, why have more?It’s simple really. There is only one type of candidate who demands additional debates: a candidate who is losing that election. This is axiomatic. It is equally axiomatic that there is only one type of candidate who declines the opportunity to debate: the candidate who is winning. Right now, Hillary Clinton is winning the primary and Bernie Sanders is losing. Both campaigns are, by and large, behaving precisely how you’d expect them to behave.(Before ardent fans of these candidates get up in my grill, please note that I’ve used the terms “winning” and “losing,” and not “won” and “lost.”)See, there is only one reason you’d want to keep debating after you’ve already debated nine times: If you’re the candidate who’s running behind, you can receive the benefit of a free media appearance, which could theoretically be leveraged to reverse your electoral fortunes. Otherwise, you wouldn’t do it. Debating is an arduous and stressful process that you have to devote resources to — resources that could otherwise be spent elsewhere. It’s only candidacies that need to use a debate as a Hail Mary play that get strenuously worked up about demanding additional debates.Candidates who are winning, or who have the inside track to winning, prefer to eliminate variables and keep a good thing going. They don’t hand their opponents an opportunity to get a leg up. Offering additional debates when you are ahead is like a football team passing on first down with a lead late in the fourth quarter — a stupid thing to do.Back in the 2012 primary season, Newt Gingrich famously challenged President Barack Obama to debate him, in the baroque style of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. He did this because he was losing, and also because he is a thorough-going egomaniac. Obama, as you might expect, refused Gingrich’s request, correctly recognizing that debating Gingrich during the GOP primary that Gingrich was losing was an insane idea with absolutely zero upside for him. Gingrich’s challenge was accepted by Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman, both of whom were also losing the race and desperate for a “game-changing” gimmick.Of course, if you cast your mind back four years earlier, guess who you’ll find saying, “I just believe that this is the most important job in the world, it’s the toughest job in the world ... you should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere”? Just guess!That’s right! It was Hillary Clinton.Is Clinton thus being hypocritical? I suppose it’s a fair charge if today is your introduction to American politics. Otherwise, no. As stated above: Losing candidates demand additional debates and winning candidates decline them. At the time of this video, Clinton was losing the primary. She’s not now. Her actions are therefore consistent. You might think it more sporting for her to participate in additional debates, but I’d call it the actions of an erratic and deeply weird campaign.But having said that, the Clinton campaign’s response to Sanders’ demand for an additional debate in New York was erratic and deeply weird.The challenge you face, if you find yourself up in a primary with your competitor nipping at you to agree to additional debates, is that when you decline to do so, your competitor is going to dine out a little on your refusal and categorize you as a coward. It’s a bit of bitter fruit, but it’s best to digest it quickly and skip to the part where your opponent’s repeated demands start making them look desperate. The best way to dodge additional debates is simply to cite scheduling difficulties and move on, optimistically, to your own campaign events.This is a feat that Clinton campaign strategist Joel Benenson almost managed in an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan, before he totally cocked it all up. As Politico’s Nick Gass reported:CNN’s Kate Bolduan then inquired why the campaign would not agree to debate in New York despite agreeing in January to more debates. Benenson responded, “Because we agreed to debates up to a certain point. We’re now out campaigning in these states.”See? That’s fine. Fine. The campaign fulfilled their obligation, and now has a busy schedule of campaigning. Nothing more needs to be said, just stick to that.Unfortunately for Benenson, in an earlier part of the interview, Bolduan asked him to respond to “a Washington Post story in which Sanders’ campaign discussed possible efforts to sharpen rhetoric against the former secretary of state.” Benenson responded archly, noting that Sanders, who’d previously suggested that he’d not run negative ads, was now doing so and planning to continue.So when Bolduan’s follow-up question about Sanders’ debate demand inevitably came, rather than stick to his “we’re now out campaigning” talking point, Benenson attempted a hybrid response that recalled his critique of Sanders negative tone, and got it all wrong:“What’s the risk?” Bolduan asked.“There’s no risk. She’s done very well in the debates. The debates have been very good, but Sen. Sanders doesn’t get to decide when we debate, particularly when he’s running a very negative campaign against us. Let’s see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on. If he does that, then we’ll talk about debates,” Benenson said.“So no chance of a New York debate?” Bolduan pressed.“I didn’t say that,” Benenson said. “I said we’re going to see what kind of tone he sets.”And that’s just ridiculous. In the first place, there is absolutely no way that a change in Sanders’ campaign tone might open the door to an additional New York debate. To suggest that the Sanders campaign could merit itself another debate if it would start behaving to the liking of the Clinton campaign is false on its face. Come on, man.But more to the point, suggesting that it’s Sanders’ critical tone that’s driving the Clinton campaign from agreeing to an additional debate might be the daffiest thing I’ve ever heard. What is a debate if not an opportunity for the debaters to raise criticisms of each other? For Clinton’s campaign strategist to suggest that Sanders hasn’t earned the right to criticize Clinton on the debate stage because he keeps criticizing her off the debate stage is a contention that demands mockery.The truth is that the only one with a tonal problem here is Benenson, who easily could have set aside Sanders’ request with a little optimistic talk about a successful campaign with a packed schedule of campaign stops. Instead, he boofed it, creating a completely needless news cycle distraction, and reminding us once again that the Clinton campaign team strangely treats the actual process of campaigning as an unnecessary hardship that’s been somehow foisted upon them unfairly.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
A ‘Protest’ Against Tammy Duckworth May Not Have Been Real,468,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) was greeted by a few dozen African-American protesters outside a Monday gathering in Chicago. They held up handwritten signs accusing the Senate candidate of ignoring their community and chanted that it was time for her to go.But when they started talking to the press, something was off.One demonstrator asked a Chicago Tribune reporter “whether Duckworth is a Democrat or a Republican” and said he was being paid “by the man who sponsored” the protest. Before he could say more, other demonstrators nearby told him to stop talking. The group then refused to answer questions about why they were there or if they were supporters of Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), whom Duckworth is trying to unseat in November.Blue Nation Review, a progressive blog, reported that an attendee at Duckworth’s event recognized some of the protesters as residents of a local homeless shelter. Demonstrators were also fine with accepting food from Duckworth’s campaign. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that staffers brought out bacon and eggs after the event ended, and protesters munched away.So who was leading these protesters, and were they being paid?Sean Savett, a spokesman for the Illinois Democratic Party, passed along a video of the Kirk campaign’s field director, Matthew Custardo, offering coffee and donuts to those demonstrating against Duckworth. Savett said a Democratic colleague who was at the event witnessed Custardo “organizing and encouraging the protesters.”Kirk campaign spokesman Kevin Artl said the campaign didn’t organize the protesters or pay them. He confirmed that Custardo was there, but said he wasn’t directing operations. Artl said Custardo was there as a tracker, filming the scene outside Duckworth’s “unity breakfast” with local black leaders. Some Democratic state officials had planned to boycott the event because they didn’t think Duckworth had done enough to prioritize the black community.“We don’t have a large staff, so the only one we assigned to track that event from our campaign was Matt,” Artl said in an email. “We were trying to get a good idea of who was attending the breakfast and who was boycotting.”But Savett noted that former Kirk campaign staffer Jeff Coleman, who previously did urban outreach for the senator, was mixed in with the protesters. Savett also pointed to a second person in another video who he claimed comes to Duckworth events “all the time” to track activities for Kirk. That individual, who Savett said works for the conservative group America Rising, appears to be carrying a camera at Monday’s event.Artl emphasized that that tracker “is not on our campaign” and said it is “totally inaccurate” to say that Custardo was there to do anything but document people going in and out of the meeting. He also said there was nothing unusual about Custardo mingling with protesters and offering them coffee.“There were 60 people outside protesting Tammy Duckworth — you better believe we were going to talk to them, and I have no qualms about buying them a cup of coffee either,” Artl said.A Duckworth campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.This isn’t the first time that things have looked sketchy in the Kirk-Duckworth race. In November, Kirk supporters were caught using a fake minimum wage petition to put his name on the ballot. The Kirk campaign denied any involvement.The Illinois Senate race is shaping up to be one of the closest and most expensive races of the year. Polling from last summer showed Duckworth with a slight lead, and she raised more money in the last quarter of 2015 — $1.6 million to Kirk’s $1 million.Share this slide:"
"Scott Walker Endorses Ted Cruz, Says He’s In The ‘Best Position’ To Win GOP Nomination",1122,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) endorsed onetime opponent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Tuesday for the GOP presidential nomination, one week ahead of the primary in his state. “I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall of this year,” Walker said on Newsradio WTMJ, a Wisconsin station, referring to the current Democratic front-runner. “The key is we want people who are principled common-sense conservatives, who are people who do what they say, who stick to their guns but also people who can both win the nomination and go on to defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall,” he continued.Walker said he is “all in” and will campaign with Cruz ahead of the primary. Recent polling on the contest shows the Texas senator and GOP nationwide front-runner Donald Trump are in a tight race.He insisted his endorsement isn’t just about defeating Trump and repeatedly said he chose Cruz based on his credentials, such as his “excellent” tax policy, plans to expand the military and willingness to buck the party.“I wanted to make sure that I was supporting someone, I wasn’t against something or against someone but rather being for something,” he said. “After a lot of time looking at speeches, looking at the records, looking at what the candidates not only say but what they’ve done in the past, it was an easy call for me to support Ted Cruz.”Walker dropped out of the presidential race in September, after struggling to maintain funding for his sinking campaign. At the time, he encouraged opponents to drop out of the race as well “so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner,” a reference to Trump.In endorsing Cruz, Walker passed over Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is trailing Trump and Cruz in delegates. Both are seeking to prevent Trump from getting to the 1,237 delegates he needs to lock up the Republican nomination at the party’s convention this summer. Walker said he thinks Cruz will win in Wisconsin, which will put him “firmly in the path” to get the delegates needed to win the nomination. Share this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Most Americans Support A Pathway To Citizenship For Unauthorized Immigrants,1095,"A new report shows considerable support for immigration reform. It’s not clear which presidential candidate benefits most from fear of terrorism. And Americans are divided on a proposals to monitor Muslim neighborhoods. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, March 29, 2016. YOUNG REPUBLICANS SEE IMMIGRATION AS A POSITIVE - Public Religion Research Institute: “Following months of anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy proposals to toughen border security and increase deportations, from Donald Trump and other leading Republican Presidential candidates, a report released today finds that such rhetoric may not resonate with Republicans under the age of 30….The survey—which included interviews with 1,083 Republicans between the ages of 18 and 29—finds that a slim majority (51 percent) of young Republicans say that the increasing number of newcomers to the country strengthens American culture and way of life, compared to 36 percent who say they are a threat. In contrast, only 22 percent of Republican seniors (age 65 or older) believe that recent immigrants strengthen American society, compared to 61 percent who say they are a threat…’While the campaigns of the leading Republican presidential candidates have been fueled by antipathy toward immigrants, these views are not reflective of the general public’s mindset and may not resonate among younger Republicans and white evangelical Protestants,’ said Dr. Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute.“ [PRRI]A pathway to citizenship is popular among the general American public - More from PRRI: “More than six in ten (62 percent) Americans say immigrants who are currently living here illegally should be allowed a way to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements, while 15 percent say these immigrants should be allowed to become permanent legal residents but not citizens, and about one in five (19 percent) say illegal immigrants should be identified and deported. Attitudes on this question have remained remarkably stable throughout 2015. With the single exception of South Dakota, majorities in all states and regions support a path to citizenship for immigrants now living in the country illegally.” [PRRI] FEAR AND ANXIETY COULD HELP TRUMP... - Michael Crowley: “Democrats insist that their presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, can harness public fear to her own advantage, saying voters will reward her long hours of experience in the White House Situation Room…Not so fast, argue a pair of academics who have studied the effect of terrorism on public opinion for more than a decade….’All of these issues are, in fact, pillars of the aggressive response we have seen by Donald Trump in response to the news today,’ said Elizabeth J. Zechmeister, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. She is the co-author, with University of California Riverside professor Jennifer L. Merolla, of the book ‘Democracy at Risk: How Terrorist Threats Affect the Public.’...In a cautionary note for Democrats, Merolla said that their research showed that frightened voters do not necessarily look for traditional leadership qualities such as Clinton’s long tenure in government. She added that female politicians ‘are typically at a disadvantage’ when terrorism is a dominant issue.’” [Politico]...Or it could help Clinton - Bethany Albertson, Joshua Busby and Shana Gadarian: “The newly released American National Election Studies (ANES) pilot study, which was conducted in January, provides a window into this question. The data show that anxiety about terrorism is concentrated among Republicans and correlated with support for Donald Trump — but there remains considerable evidence that Hillary Clinton is the candidate advantaged on this issue….Republican support may be an effect of anxiety or itself the cause of anxiety. And Clinton has considerable foreign policy experience and is more hawkish than President Obama…. Our research shows that anxiety should lead people to support expertise, not just threatening rhetoric. At the moment, these various factors work to Clinton’s advantage.” [WashPost]AMERICANS ARE DIVIDED ON PROPOSALS TARGETING MUSLIMS - HuffPollster: “In the aftermath of last week’s terrorist attacks on Brussels, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that Americans are receptive to proposals targeting Muslims, even as they acknowledge a tide of rising anti-Islamic sentiment. Forty-five percent of Americans agree with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s proposal to ‘empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,’...People who agree with proposals targeting U.S. Muslims are more reluctant to directly condone singling them out. Those polled in the new survey say by a 7-point margin that Muslims shouldn’t be subject to additional scrutiny solely because of their religion. Given the choice between two possible approaches, a 63 percent majority say it’s better for law enforcement to work with Muslim communities than to subject them to intense surveillance.” [HuffPost]  WE STILL DON’T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER - Seth Masket: “No, the nominations haven’t really been settled, but Hillary Clinton is highly likely to end up the Democratic nominee, and, barring some convention dust-up, Donald Trump is looking pretty good to be the Republicans’ choice. So can we make some guesses as to what that election looks like? We should keep in mind that polls this far from the election (still eight months away) generally aren’t very reliable. A great many voters still aren’t paying close attention to the race, and their opinions may shift as they learn more about the candidates.” [Pacific Standard]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Bernie Sanders’ Campaign Claims He Didn’t Compete In States He Actually Competed In,1860,"Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign press call Monday was billed as one to discuss his “path forward” to the Democratic nomination, but his team made some dubious claims about why he’s trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton among delegates in the process. Clinton currently leads the Vermont senator by 268 pledged delegates, 1,243 to 975. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, said on the call that their campaign chose not to compete in eight of the 32 states that have held primaries or caucuses so far. Weaver identified Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia and Louisiana as the states where they didn’t mount a challenge to Clinton, who swept all of the Southern contests; he said the Sanders campaign did not broadcast television advertisements in those eight states or have “a big campaign presence.” “Almost all of Secretary Clinton’s delegate lead come from states where she faced little or no competition,” said Tad Devine, Sanders’ senior campaign strategist. “Her grasp now on the nomination is almost entirely on the basis of victories in states where Bernie Sanders did not compete.” Devine and Weaver’s claim depends on one’s definition of the word “compete” during the Southern primaries, where Clinton netted over 300 delegates. Sanders held rallies in Austin and Dallas. He held multiple events in Virginia. He held rallies in Atlanta, Georgia. He also visited Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. His campaign had field offices in most of those states. If he wasn’t actually competing in the South, where his campaign always acknowledged he faced an uphill battle because of Clinton’s popularity among African-American voters, then why bother visiting? Devine pointed to Sanders’ victories in the Hawaii, Alaska and Washington caucuses on Saturday to advance their argument that Clinton’s delegate lead isn’t as significant as it seems. “Last weekend is a testament to the fact that where we compete with Hillary Clinton, where this competition is real, we have a very good chance of beating her in every single place that we compete with her,” he said. “In states where both campaigns have competed, Secretary Clinton has an edge in delegates but only a slight edge.”His campaign’s dismissal of his losses in the Southern primaries also doesn’t account for Clinton’s wins in Ohio, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida, which Sanders visited multiple times and where his campaign ran television ads.The rhetoric about not competing in the South is at odds with Sanders’ own argument that the Democratic Party should advance “a 50-state strategy” and Sanders’ comment after the Nevada caucus that his campaign would “be competing in 11 states all across this country on Super Tuesday.” Weaver said on the call that “reports of our death are greatly exaggerated” and that the campaign would be making “a big commitment” to delegate-rich states like New York, which holds its primary next month. “People are going to look very closely at this competition, and look at whether Hillary Clinton has proven to be a very strong nominee,” Devine said. “If you want to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, you have to consistently prove to the Democratic Party your strength, your ability to coalesce the party behind your candidacy.” Clinton’s campaign rebutted Weaver and Devine’s comments in a call with reporters Monday afternoon. “I seem to recall him campaigning quite a bit in Texas,” said Joel Benenson, Clinton’s chief strategist and pollster. “If you want to write off states that are battleground states, like Florida and North Carolina, if you don’t want to compete in battleground states like those and Virginia that are essential to winning an electoral college, to me that’s not how you set yourself up to win a general election. You compete hard in the states that are going to be the toughest for us to win in a general election because you want to get your people mobilized, you want to get them engaged.” Benenson argued that Sanders’ victories in most of the states that hold caucuses are less significant because turnout in those states tends to be lower than in primaries. “She has won in 17 of the 21 states where more than 7 percent of eligible voters turned out, when voters are coming out to the polls she has been dominating,” he said. “I think Sen. Sanders admittedly has had significant wins in caucus states, but in a lot of those states the turnout has been lower than primary states, and in many of those states they are less diverse than the rest of the country and less diverse than the coalition Democrats have to assemble to succeed in November.” Share this slide:"
White Nationalists Have Figured Out Who Should Be In President Trump’s Cabinet,605,"What do America’s white nationalists want? They want them some Donald Trump. Over the past few months, the real estate mogul and all-around class act has become the darling of what, if words didn’t mean anything, you might call America’s white-nationalist intelligentsia — the tribal lunatics who’d like the notorious “14 words” to become the first plank in the Republican Party platform. But no Trump is an island, and every president needs a cabinet. What sort of rogues’ gallery do the country’s white nationalists dream of, when they’re writing their Trump administration fan fiction? Well, thanks to the American Freedom Party, we now have an idea.In a lengthy press release circulated Monday, AFP director Tom Sunic, who claims to be a Croatian diplomat, lays out the party’s ideal membership of Trump’s cabinet, one that will definitely work to provide a “bulkhead against the forces that are destroying the peoples of European extraction worldwide.” Some of the people they’ve selected will be dismayed to have made the cut. Many others will be extremely alarmed. And Ann Coulter will probably think, “Yep, that makes sense.”Some background: The American Freedom Party is one of the dozens of minor political parties in the U.S., and it’s got its own candidate for president in the person of lifelong segregationist Robert Whitaker. Whitaker, as you might expect, is a super-chill guy who does things like try to put up billboards that read “Say NO to #WhiteGenocide!” But recently, and to his not inconsiderable dismay, Whitaker’s seen his own AFP-ers flocking to Trump instead. The fun-lovers in the American Freedom Party see Trump’s runaway momentum as a rare opportunity to bring their white nationalist views into the mainstream.AFP’s chairman, William Johnson, has supported Trump in a number of ways — launching a super PAC, running robocalls, donating to his campaign and setting up a hotline for harassed Trump supporters, with mixed success. (“We had to wade through 30 snarky, silly, vulgar and mean voice messages,” Johnson complained in an email to reporters last week. “Tell your juvenile readers to KNOCK IT OFF.” Knock it off, guys. Mature readers, as you were.) Trump, meanwhile, has been remarkably slow to denounce white nationalists, stumbling last month over questions about whether he rejected the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. (Trump, who later emphatically disavowed Duke, has not given any kind of endorsement to the AFP’s cabinet selections.)Johnson told HuffPost that AFP directors discussed the fantasy cabinet at a meeting on Saturday, and “discussions and changes were offered by all.” Unsurprisingly, AFP wants to fill a number of cabinet positions with white nationalists. Johnson himself, an attorney based in Los Angeles, is nominated as secretary of agriculture, apparently based on his experience as a “farmer.” He notes that food stamps and food subsidies will be “powerful tools to achieve repatriation of... illegal aliens.”The proposed United Nations ambassador is Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, a pseudo-intellectual journal that imagines a war against “white America.” Taylor told HuffPost earlier this month that he doesn’t consider himself a white supremacist, because he believes “East Asians are objectively superior to whites, on average, in many ways.” Meanwhile, the press secretary position in AFP’s fantasy lineup goes to James Edwards, a pro-white radio host who managed, a few weeks ago, to land an interview with Trump’s eldest son.While it’s not surprising to see the AFP suggest so many of its own as suitable agency heads, a few of the selections are bound to put some people in an awkward position. You know how sometimes, someone who you’re not really interested in will ask you out, and then you have to find a graceful way to decline? That, but with racists.Some members of the AFP’s dream team are the sorts of mainstream or at least mainstream-ish people whose names you may have even heard on the news. The AFP prefers New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for the vice presidential slot. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), they say, would slot into the attorney general’s office, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich would run the Pentagon, because he “informally advised Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and hopefully has learned that foreign entanglements are bad for America.”Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) would, to the AFP’s mind, make a “great choice for Energy Tsar.” And to make things not as #TrumpCabinetSoWhite as they could be, sleepy-eyed Dr. Ben Carson would take over the role of surgeon general.From here, things grow less tethered to reality. Anti-immigration kook Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is the AFP’s choice to run the State Department. The aforementioned Coulter would serve as — oh, man, you guys — the director of homeland security (because she would “do what needs doing,” and who thought those four words could ever sound so terrifying). Former Rep. Ron Paul is the AFP’s top pick to run the Treasury, but in a nod to his advanced age, the white nationalists say they’d also accept his son Rand for that position.There’s also a smattering of out-of-left-field lefties, because white nationalists like economic populism as much as the next guy. The AFP has plum positions in mind for Green Party stalwart Jill Stein (EPA director), Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (labor secretary) and Sen. Bernie Sanders, of all people, to act as U.S. trade representative. One imagines this is a vote of confidence Sanders could do without.Also, fun fact: Elon Musk is the AFP’s pick to run the Transportation Department, because someone has to put white nationalists on Mars, apparently. (Actually, somebody really does.)Finally, the AFP left what it considers to be the most important job in the Trump administration to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. She would be President Trump’s chief of staff, a role that would involve dismantling a number of other government posts, among them the secretary of education. So, the most difficult and demanding job in any presidential administration would be given to someone famous for intermittently serving as Alaska’s governor, and who has floated between odd jobs ever since. Cool.If there’s good news to be had here, it’s that it is extremely unlikely this white nationalist fantasy cabinet will ever be assembled. The bad news, of course, is that a cabinet handpicked by Trump himself could very well be much, much crazier.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
Blue Dog Democratic Congressman Plans To Vote For Bernie Sanders,17949,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Collin Peterson (Minn.), one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, says he’ll cast his vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president if he attends the Democratic National Convention in July.Peterson told Forum News Service on Saturday that his vote at the convention would reflect the will of his constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Sanders in the state’s March 1 Democratic caucuses. Sanders won Peterson’s district with 63 percent of the vote, compared to Hillary Clinton’s 37 percent.“I’m voting my district,” he said. “I’m going to vote for Bernie.”While it’s understandable that a congressman would vote for the candidate backed by his constituents, it’s a stunning state of affairs for the Democratic Party that Peterson is aligning with Sanders, the socialist from Vermont who supports same-sex marriage, abortion rights and gun control. Peterson is a co-founder of the Blue Dog Coalition, the caucus of moderate House Democrats, and is known for his conservatism. He’s anti-abortion, opposed to embryonic stem cell research, against same-sex marriage and supports the death penalty. He is also avidly anti-gun control.The Minnesota Democrat said he’d only cast his vote for Sanders over Clinton if he goes to the convention, which he doesn’t always attend. He noted, though, that the Vermont senator seems to have reinvigorated the party.“If my vote makes a difference, I’ll probably go,” Peterson told Forum News Service. “He’s got something going. He’s tapped into something.”Share this slide:"
"A Bird Lands On Bernie Sanders’ Podium, And A Disney Princess Meme Takes Flight",1559,"When a small bird landed on Bernie Sander’s podium during a speech in Portland, Oregon, on March 25, it almost seemed like a scene from a Disney movie.It didn’t take long for the Internet to make the connection.

John Kerry: Republican Primary Race Is ‘An Embarrassment’,9496,"Secretary of State John Kerry said the Republican presidential primary is “an embarrassment.”During an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Kerry said foreign leaders are “shocked” by the rhetoric used in the race, particularly anti-Muslim statements.“They don’t know where it’s taking the United States of America,” Kerry said. “It upsets people’s sense of equilibrium about our steadiness, about our reliability, and to some degree I must say to you, some of the questions, the way they’re posed to me, it’s clear to me that what’s happening is an embarrassment to our country.”Watch Kerry’s comments above. (Story continues below.)In December, GOP frontrunner and business mogul Donald Trump proposed a ban for all Muslims looking to enter the United States. He defended that proposal in January after a clip of him talking about the ban was used in a propaganda video by Somali militant group al-Shabab. Trump’s presidential primary rival, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), said after the Brussels attacks he thinks the U.S. should “patrol and secure“ Muslim communities. “That does not mean targeting Muslims. It means targeting radical Islamic terrorism,” Cruz said last week.Share this slide:"
GOP Senator Touts Work For Company That Allegedly Sold Faulty Helmets To Army,1326,"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman is touting his work on behalf of ArmorSource, a manufacturer of protective headgear based in his home state, in a new re-election ad this week. The Republican lawmaker recalls how he intervened on behalf of ArmorSource to make sure the company had the chance to bid on a federal contract to make helmets for U.S. troops.What the ad doesn’t say is that earlier this month, ArmorSource paid $3 million to settle allegations that helmets it previously sold to the U.S. military “did not conform to contract requirements and failed to meet contract performance standards.” According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the helmets “failed ballistic safety tests.”A whistleblower lawsuit alleged that ArmorSource delivered faulty helmets from 2006 to 2009. After problems emerged, the Army began recalling the headgear in May 2010. Troops in Iraq and Afghanistan that year were told to trade in their ArmorSource helmets for ones made by a different company.ArmorSource blamed the helmet failure on a subcontractor, Federal Prison Industries (also known as UNICOR), that uses inmate labor to produce a wide range of products.  Three years after the helmet recall, Portman intervened to make sure that ArmorSource was allowed to bid for another major helmet contract with the Department of Defense. The company won the contract, and Portman took credit for helping.But as the senator was speaking up for ArmorSource, the company was still fighting the whistleblower lawsuit related to the faulty helmets. The Justice Department chose to join that suit — a step that can help pressure companies into settling. An ArmorSource spokeswoman distinguished the two contracts. “The settlement in question and the lightweight advanced combat helmet (LWACH) are two entirely separate contracts,” she said. “The LWACH is the helmet for which Senator Portman ensured fair and open competition. The Department of Defense is the sole entity responsible for awarding the LWACH contract. Of all vendors awarded LWACH contracts, and there were three, ArmorSource is the only one who was able to pass all of the Army’s ballistic testing requirements.”A spokesman for Portman’s campaign responded to HuffPost’s request for comment with a statement attacking former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, the senator’s Democratic challenger in this fall’s election. The statement did not address the ad or explain why Portman chose to intervene on behalf of ArmorSource. Portman is currently polling neck and neck with Strickland, making the Ohio Senate race one of the most closely watched in the nation.“Equipment that fails to meet performance standards not only cheats taxpayers, but can put lives at risk,” said Benjamin Mizer, head of DOJ’s Civil Division, in announcing the settlement on March 7. Contractors “must deliver on their promises, especially when the safety and security of our troops is on the line,” said Monte Cason of DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General."
Arizona’s Primary Problems Go Way Beyond Long Lines,2792,"Jennifer Robbins’ appalling experience with Arizona’s election process illustrates just how chaotic the state’s presidential primary was on Tuesday.Robbins, 27, had never before “found a politician that I felt like I could put my faith in.” But the message of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) resonated with her, she said. In February, she registered in Maricopa County, looking forward to voting for the first time in her life. Arizona uses a closed primary system, meaning that a voter must register as a Democrat to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate or as a Republican to vote on the GOP side. Robbins registered as a Democrat on Feb. 18, four days before the primary registration deadline. She received her voter registration card identifying her as a Democrat in the mail. On Tuesday, Robbins brought her 9-month-old son to a polling site in Avondale, Arizona, and stood in line for two hours, waiting to vote. One she was inside, a poll worker scanned her identification card and said she came up in the system as “party not designated.” The poll worker suggested that Robbins cast a provisional ballot.Robbins insisted they scan her card again. This time, the system said she was registered as a Republican. She was told she wouldn’t be able to vote a regular ballot, even when she showed her voter registration card.Robbins says the poll worker told her that her provisional ballot probably wouldn’t count. Arizona discards more provisional ballots than most larger states, so this was probably correct. Robbins says she asked for a number where she could call and complain, and the poll worker refused to give her one.Robbins reached out to the office of Michele Reagan, Arizona’s secretary of state. She was told that she was indeed registered as a Democrat. Then she was transferred to a supervisor who told her that even though she had registered before the deadline, the state hadn’t processed her registration in time, and therefore she wasn’t actually registered. “I’ve waited my entire adult life, and I finally find somebody I want to vote for, and they deny me,” Robbins said. “I left there crying. It’s always been my dream to vote, but I hadn’t found a politician I liked enough to vote for.” Robbins’ experience on Tuesday wasn’t unique. A number of Arizona-based outlets reported that there were widespread problems with voter registration in several counties. The Washington Post reports that election officials blamed a computer glitch that switched Democrats to independents in the system.The media, meanwhile, has mainly focused on the long lines that formed at voting places throughout Maricopa County. Some voters waited up to five hours on Tuesday to cast a ballot. The long lines were a predictable result of the county’s decision to cut its number of voting sites from 200 to 60, which the county said it did to cut costs. (Pima County, which has just one-fourth as many eligible voters as Maricopa County, had more than twice as many polling places this week.)Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell (R), who is in charge of the county’s elections, partially blamed “the voters, for getting in line,” but later admitted to making “bad decisions” and said the county had underestimated how many voting sites it would need. Purcell’s office did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment.Theresa Caplis, 47, has lived in the same house in Gilbert, Arizona, for 12 years. Like Robbins, she had problems voting in Maricopa County this Tuesday. Caplis and her husband waited two hours to vote at library near their house, and while he had no problem casting a regular ballot, she was told that she had already voted when the poll worker scanned her identification. She was told she had requested an early ballot (she hadn’t), and the poll worker gave her a provisional ballot. She says she doesn’t know whether her vote actually counted. “I’ve never seen that many people vote with provisional ballots before,” Caplis told HuffPost. “The containers for the provisional ballots were full. I could hardly fit mine in.” Caplis joked that this happened to her because she’d canvassed for Sanders the weekend before.“I felt like they’re trying to have someone win. I feel like it’s set up,” she said. “Someone is interfering with the process.”The number of comments and suspicions voiced by Sanders supporters on Reddit after the primary led Marc Elias, campaign counsel for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to weigh in. Elias argued that the way Maricopa County ran its election is “the result of a larger Republican effort to make it harder for people to vote.” “Now, some have suggested that this whole thing is a plot to shut Sanders supporters out of the process,” he wrote Wednesday on Reddit. “This just isn’t true. In Arizona (like most states), county governments administer elections. Neither the Clinton campaign nor the Sanders campaign — nor for that matter the Trump campaign — have anything to do with them, beyond being on the ballot. And the county with the biggest issues last night — Maricopa — is run almost entirely by Republicans. (In fact, there’s only one Democrat serving on the county government, and he’s a Sanders supporter.)”Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement Wednesday that the state’s election officials must investigate what went wrong with the primary and prevent similar problems in the future. He called for making the state’s primaries open, rather than closed, so independent voters can participate. But Democrats say the state needs to focus more on the reduction in voting sites, which Ducey didn’t mention in his statement. Democrats have noted that predominantly Latino areas in Arizona had fewer voting sites this week than areas with greater numbers of white people. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton (D) wrote the Department of Justice Wednesday asking it to investigate how Maricopa County officials “distributed fewer polling locations to parts of the county with higher minority populations.” As Zach Roth at MSNBC and Ari Berman at The Nation have noted, Maricopa County probably wouldn’t have been able to slash its number of voting sites so dramatically if the Supreme Court hadn’t gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. That federal civil rights act required Arizona and other states with a history of racial discrimination in elections to get approval from the DOJ or a federal court before making any changes to their electoral procedures or policies, to ensure such changes wouldn’t leave voters of color worse off. But those protections have been greatly weakened.Share this slide:"
The Bizarre Story Of Trump’s First Congressional Endorsement,396,"WASHINGTON — When Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) became the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president, the reaction on Capitol Hill ranged from, “Um, what?” to “Uh, who?”Collins, a rank-and-file Republican who had previously endorsed Jeb Bush, wasn’t exactly on the shortlist of members expected to get on board with the bombastic and increasingly conservative Trump.But the story behind Collins’ support is maybe just as strange as the endorsement itself. A recent report from Syracuse.com detailed how deep-pocketed real estate developer and former New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino might have played a key role in securing Collins’ backing for Trump, describing how Paladino told GOP members from New York to get behind the front-runner or else face the wrath of his email list — or maybe even a primary challenger.The pressure caused Collins to recently send this text message to his New York colleagues:“I know Carl Paladino has been aggressively pushing all of you to endorse Trump. And I know he has indicated he will start ‘attacking’ NYers who don’t endorse Trump. You may or may not care, but he does have a formidable email list.”In an interview with The Huffington Post this week, Collins denied he was “pressured” into supporting Trump, saying he endorsed the GOP front-runner without speaking to Paladino about it.But pressed on whether the two had discussed an endorsement, he backtracked:“Uh, so — I mean, Carl and I know each other,” Collins said.Either way, Collins acknowledged that Paladino is a “big Trump guy” and that “he’s been pushing other New York members to endorse.”Collins told HuffPost that his role between Paladino and the other New York Republican members was brokering a sort of detente, where Paladino would lay off pushing for an endorsement before the primary filing deadline and Collins would remind his colleagues that, once the deadline had passed, Paladino would be back at it.Regardless, Collins says he believes Trump is the best man for the job — “no two ways about it.” “He’s the only chief executive, not chief politician,” Collins said.When asked whether he has any concerns about some of Trump’s more egregious behavior and remarks, Collins came up with an explanation that was downright Trumpian.“What I’m going to say is he’s been misquoted many times,” Collins said.When pressed that he’s clearly been accurately quoted many times, saying horrific things about women and minorities, among others, Collins said, “Well, he’s also been misquoted, and they’ve taken things out of context.”After some crosstalk, Collins said, “I’m very comfortable with his stance on defense, I’m very comfortable with his stance on jobs, I’m very comfortable with — his actions speak louder than words on the women’s issues.”Pressed about Trump’s statements on women, Collins interrupted the question and blurted out, “I’m saying actions speak louder than words!”When the actions of Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who’s been accused of roughly grabbing a reporter and making sexually charged comments about female reporters, came up, an aide nearby tried to end the interview.“I am solidly, 100 percent behind Donald Trump,” Collins said, summing up his final thought.Collins comes from a strongly Republican district covering Buffalo, New York, where Paladino lives. Whether Paladino actually threatened Collins with a primary challenge — either to run himself or put someone up with his considerable fortune — is unknown, but it’s clear Paladino has been pressuring New York Republicans to support Trump.Another New York Republican, Rep. Lee Zeldin, told HuffPost this week that he got the impression Paladino was “reaching out to everyone” in the delegation.Asked whether it sounded plausible that Paladino and Collins hadn’t talked about endorsing Trump before Collins came out in public support, Zeldin gave an incredulous look.“You’re — you’re saying that Collins said he didn’t speak to Paladino before he announced that he was endorsing Trump? I mean, I — I don’t know anything about their relationship,” Zeldin said.One thing, however, is known: Another New York Republican, Rep. Tom Reed, endorsed Trump last week — the same week that Paladino sent an email out to 50,000+ recipients with the subject line: “Anyone interested in running in a primary to defeat Elise Stefanik?”Stefanik is the youngest woman to ever serve in Congress and is another New York Republican.Share this slide:"
Why Ted Cruz Should Drop Everything And Watch ‘Zootopia’ Immediately,1571,"It’s not easy grabbing a few hours of downtime when you’re desperately trying to keep yourself in contention for the Republican nomination for president, but if Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) gets a chance over the weekend, he should see Disney’s new hit animated feature “Zootopia.”The movie is about an evolved city populated by anthropomorphic animals where all kinds of creatures live in harmony — predators and prey — until something happens that shakes up their peaceful existence. The movie has been a major hit for Disney, grossing more than $200 million and currently in the top spot at the box office.“Zootopia” is great fun, but for a kids’ film it also packs a pretty serious message about racial profiling. In short: Policing people based on the color of their skin — or in the movie’s case, mammal type —  is a terrible strategy. Not only is it ineffective, but profiling also pits citizens against each other, rending the very fabric that holds society together.Cruz is not on board with that message, it would seem. On Tuesday, not that long after terrorist bombings in Brussels killed at least 31 people and injured 270, he was quick to say we should police all Muslims in the U.S. to prevent attacks here.“We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,” he said in a statement. The next day, under heavy criticism, he doubled down, defending himself against what he called “political correctness.” Cruz pointed to a controversial post-9/11 surveillance program run in New York City as a good example of what he has in mind.  Yet that sweeping program was entirely ineffective — it didn’t lead to any arrests or new terror cases in six years of spying on Muslim neighborhoods. This New York magazine story is a must-read for anyone who thinks patrolling entire populations is a good idea.Even without reading the detailed look at how the NYPD program failed to do much more than expose police officers to delicious food at the Kabul Kabob House in Flushing, Queens, consider what slapping the label of “potential terrorist” on an entire group of people would mean to those people.Would the feeling that your very own government thought you were a baddie serve to make you feel more like a citizen, or less? Would it endear you to your leaders and local law enforcement workers and make you want to help them? Would it make other people more or less kind and neighborly toward you?This is a key issue in “Zootopia.” The movie’s protagonist  — a feisty, animated bunny, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, seeks to become the first rabbit police officer in the city. And in her push to make it, she faces all kinds of blowback and discrimination. At one point she tells another animal, “A bunny can call another bunny cute, but you can’t!”Representatives from Ted Cruz’s campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post’s query about whether Cruz had seen the film.[Warning: Spoilers ahead.]The bunny does become a cop. For a while, she’s relegated to meter maid status because she’s viewed as an incompetent “token bunny,” but ultimately she winds up on a pretty big, complex case.Something’s gone deeply wrong in Zootopia, she discovers: Predator animals (tigers, foxes) are going “native,” and killing prey.Our bunny hero, instead of trying to figure out what’s going on, suggests publicly that these animals are just returning to their true “nature.” Everyone takes this as a signal that predatory mammals must be heavily watched, locked up, shunned.Havoc follows. The city is torn apart as everyone starts shunning predator animals, and citizens live under a haze of fear, paranoia and suspicion.Ted Cruz really should find out what happens next."
Lindsey Graham On The 2016 Election: ‘My Party Is Completely Screwed Up’,6675,"For Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the only thing worse than the prospect of Ted Cruz as president is the prospect of Donald Trump as president.Graham begrudgingly expressed his support for Cruz in an interview with Trevor Noah on Wednesday night, telling “The Daily Show” host that the Texas senator was his “15th choice” to win the GOP nomination.Graham ultimately concluded that Cruz should be the nominee because “he’s not Trump.”And that’s where things got interesting.“If Donald Trump carries the banner of my party,” Graham said, “I think it taints conservatism for generations to come. I think his campaign is opportunistic, race-baiting, religious bigotry, xenophobia. Other than that, he’d be a good nominee.”Noah played a short video clip from late January in which Graham, who was himself a candidate earlier in the presidential race, was asked if he preferred a Cruz nomination or a Trump nomination.“That’s... like [asking if I’d rather be] shot or poisoned,” Graham responded in the video, “What does it really matter?”Asked by Noah which candidate is doing the shooting and which is the poison, Graham answered, “Donald is like being shot in the head. You might find an antidote to poisoning, I don’t know, but maybe there’s time.”“I’m saying my party is completely screwed up for the moment,” he added.Share this slide:"
"In Trump’s World, Women Have Always Been Objects",13894,"The tagline for the 2016 GOP race might as well be, “Make America Misogynist Again.”On Wednesday night, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz got into a Twitter spat. After a conservative anti-Trump SuperPAC ran a gross, slut-shaming ad which used a half-naked photograph of Trump’s wife Melania, Trump threatened to “spill the beans” on Cruz’s wife, Heidi, presumably because he thought Cruz was behind the ad. (The SuperPAC is not affiliated with the Cruz campaign, though it is backing Cruz against Trump.) Trump then retweeted the below image, which compares a model shot of Melania with an unflattering photograph of Heidi. “These images are worth a thousand words,” reads the meme, implying that when it comes to the position of First Lady, all that matters is a woman’s hotness.To Cruz’s credit — and I truly can’t believe I’m giving a man who has compared abortion to slavery credit for anything that has to do with women — Cruz didn’t take Trump’s bait. Instead he responded with this tweet:The exchange was gross and depressing, in the midst of an election cycle full of a whole lot of gross and depressing. But seeing Trump treat Melania and Heidi as props isn’t the least bit surprising. It’s simply a reflection of the way he speaks about women in general. As far as Trump is concerned, women are objects — the shinier the better. He has said that it doesn’t matter what the media says about you “as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.” He has spoken explicitly about how beautiful his daughter is and how she has “the best body,” even going so far as to suggest that if she wasn’t related to him, he would date her. He has implied that female journalists’ success hinges on their attractiveness, and called a member of The Washington Post’s editorial board “beautiful” just this week. And as much joy as Trump seems to take in linking women’s success and worth to their good looks, he has been equally, if not more, gleeful in his “take down” of women whose looks he doesn’t consider worthy of his approval. According to Trump, Rosie O’Donnell has a “fat, ugly face.” Bette Middler has an “ugly face and body.” Hillary Clinton couldn’t keep her husband “satisfied.” Megyn Kelly is a “bimbo” who objectifies herself because she once posed for GQ. Carly Fiorina could never win an election, because of her face. And now, as his Twitter feed implies, all America needs to know about Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump is that one of them is younger and hotter according to some men on Twitter. For Trump, and the GOP candidates writ large, the 2016 election has come down to a pathetic (and terrifying) rallying cry for traditional masculinity. There have been comments about hand size and comments about dick size and comments about Marco Rubio’s “high-heeled booties.” Trump has indirectly called Cruz a “pussy” and a “soft, weak little baby,” and said that Romney would have “dropped to his knees” for a 2012 endorsement. As The Guardian’s Jessica Valenti put it, Trump and Cruz have officially “gone full cavemen.” We are seeing the #MasculinitySoFragile hashtag play out in real time. As women — or any group of people who aren’t straight, white men — continue to demand their voices be heard, and that policy change accordingly, we will see a backlash from those traditional arbiters of power. The 2016 GOP race has become their vicious last stand. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Ted Cruz Might Not Be Able To Stop Donald Trump,383,"Donald Trump looks increasingly unstoppable in the primary, but weaker in the general election. A contested convention could divide the Republican Party even more. And a “gold-standard” national health study struggles with response rates. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, March 24, 2016. TED CRUZ PROBABLY ISN’T THE REPUBLICAN PARTY’S SAVIOR - HuffPollster: “The GOP establishment seems convinced that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could stop the insurgent presidential front-runner Donald Trump, if only Ohio Gov. John Kasich would drop out and simplify the field. But polling suggests that even if Kasich were to suspend his campaign, Cruz’s support wouldn’t grow enough to stop Trump. According to a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday, Trump would defeat Cruz by a 9-point margin if the race were narrowed down to just the two of them….Kasich doesn’t fare any better against Trump in a two-man scenario….The current trajectory suggests it’s unlikely that any of the GOP candidates can win the 1,237 delegates it would take to capture the nomination by the time of the Republican National Convention in July. At this point, Trump is the only candidate who has a slim chance. And with several winner-take-all states ahead, Cruz can forget about winning the nomination unless he starts outperforming Trump. The only hope for Cruz now, and for the GOP establishment, is to pose enough of a challenge to Trump to ensure the race enters a contested convention.” [HuffPost] But polls show Trump weak in November - Alan Rappeport: “According to a survey from Quinnipiac University, Mr. Trump continues to be the most popular candidate with Republican voters, but he trails Mrs. Clinton in a hypothetical matchup by a margin of six percentage points, 46 percent to 40 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Mr. Kasich, who has won only Ohio, his home state, so far, is the strongest against Mrs. Clinton, leading her by 8 points while Mr. Cruz trails Mrs. Clinton by 3 points. The poll finds that Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also facing long odds in his race with Mrs. Clinton, would be the strongest Democratic candidate in matchups against Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, and he is essentially tied with Mr. Kasich.” [NYT] Be careful with general election polls - HuffPost Pollster’s averages of head-to-head matchups show Trump falling farther behind both Democratic candidates. These are early polls, though, and are likely not predictive of what would happen in November. Polls become more predictive of the outcome when the candidates are set and voters are paying more attention. With 228 days to go before the election and neither nominee determined yet, general election polls shouldn’t be taken as certainties.A CONTESTED CONVENTION WON’T HELP THE GOP -  HuffPollster: “If Trump fails to collect the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination outright, he may actually be the least-divisive option for the party. The alternatives, which involve the party coalescing around Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ohio Gov. John Kasich, or a yet-to-be-named dark horse, risk giving the appearance of party elites overriding the will of the electorate. That may be even more toxic than polarizing candidates in a campaign notable for hostility to the establishment. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 52 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say that if Trump falls short of a majority of delegates, they’d still prefer to see him chosen as the nominee…. just 40 percent of GOP voters say they’d be enthusiastic about Trump winning. That actually makes Trump the consensus candidate, with fewer than 30 percent of GOP voters saying they’d be enthusiastic about any scenario that wasn’t a Trump nomination. Just 4 percent of GOP voters say they’d prefer to see a new candidate chosen as the nominee, and just 16 percent would be satisfied with such an outcome. The vast majority, 55 percent, say they’d be outright upset.” [HuffPost]Other polling shows similar results - A Monmouth poll shows that 54 percent of Republicans think Trump should get the nomination if he has the most delegates even in a contested convention. Only 34 percent would prefer another candidate. Similarly, a CNN poll shows that 60 percent of GOP voters think delegates should vote for the candidate with the most support in a contested convention. Only 35 percent say they’d like to see another Republican get in the race as a third party candidate if Trump wins the nomination. [CNN, Monmouth]MAJOR HEALTH SURVEY FACES DECLINING RESPONSE RATES -  Maggie Koerth-Baker: “[E]very year since 1957, tens of thousands of Americans have opened their homes to government survey takers who poke and prod their way through a list of intimate and occasionally uncomfortable questions. That process is part of the National Health Interview Survey, the gold standard of health data in the United States.….At issue is the question of how long anybody can reasonably expect Americans to put up with sharing intimate details of their lives with taxpayer-funded bureaucrats….Twenty years ago, the NHIS lasted about an hour. But over time, more government agencies and scientists wanted to add more and more questions to make it more and more useful. Meanwhile, participation has been dropping. In 1997, the survey had a 91.8 percent response rate. ‘The response rate today is about 70-73 percent,’ Blumberg said….The NHIS is not the only survey that’s losing respondents over time. Across the board, fewer and fewer Americans are choosing to participate in surveys of all kinds.” [538]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Fox News: Hillary Clinton Was ‘A Little Too Calm’ While Giving Speech On Foreign Policy,4955,"When it comes to her voice, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton can’t win.Fox News host Heather Nauert and guest Monica Crowley criticized the former secretary of state Wednesday for being “a little too calm” while delivering a foreign policy speech at Stanford University.“Did you notice that calm and collected tone of voice right there? She said we needed ‘strong, steady leadership,’ implying the Republican candidates could not provide that,” Nauert said.“She’s a little too calm,” Crowley said, before claiming President Barack Obama has been criticized for being “passionless.”“You see more passion from Democrats when they’re attacking Republicans than when they’re attacking actual enemies of the United States,” Crowley added.Just last week, Clinton was criticized by Fox News’ Brit Hume for “shouting angrily” while speaking after winning several primary races. Fox News’ Howard Kurtz encouraging her to use “a more conversational tone.”Well, she tried it, anyway. Unsurprisingly, people weren’t satisfied.(h/t Raw Story)Share this slide:"

Trump has captured the approval of many outside the American electorate.In this installment of our special election series on Donald J. Trump, OZY reports on how the rest of the world views the Republican front-runner. Hint: It’s probably not what you think. Stay tuned for more pieces as the billionaire continues his march to the GOP nomination and, perhaps, the Oval Office.Erick Rhesa just can’t get enough of his political idol. The 30-year-old farmer stays up till the wee hours to watch primary results and, when the Donald reigns supreme — as he did on Super Tuesday — Rhesa can sometimes be heard gleefully shouting: “Trump for president!” In Rhesa’s eyes, like many others, Trump’s the only candidate deserving of the big gig in the Oval Office, because he’s brave enough to speak out against migration: “He is right about Mexicans or Syrians,” says Rhesa. “We have the same problem in Kenya; we have let thousands of Somali refugees in, and now we have terrorism!”Trump mania has officially gone global. From the streets of Mumbai to matatus in Nairobi, where OZY’s Laura Secorun Palet caught up with Rhesa, a conservative Kenyan, Trump’s message is resonating with a surprising number of people. Not only has the blustery billionaire developed a keen sense of the American electorate’s mood, experts say, but he’s also finding a kind of global constituency: pockets of discontented people around the world who agree with some of his nationalistic stances on trade agreements, battling “radical Islamic terrorism” and curbing the flow of certain migrants. Sure, not everyone’s a fan, or totally sold on the reality-TV king yet. Sebastian Rivas, a Chilean reporter, says his countrymen are worried about the type of relationship they might have with the U.S. given Trump’s anti-immigrant speeches, while Natchapol Praditpetchara, a 23-year-old researcher at the Thailand Development Research Institute, is much more blunt: “His rhetoric is poisonous and is tearing away the soul of the country.” What else do people around the world think about the GOP’s front-runner? Here’s what our global team of reporters found in…Trump’s views on immigration, border control and family values have resonated with parts of conservative, Catholicism-steeped Italy, says Marco Perduca, a former Italian senator and current U.N. representative for the Nonviolent Radical Party. And young Italians don’t seem all that surprised by Trump’s rise; rather, it feels like déja vù all over again. After all, notes our Paris-based reporter Fiona Zublin, the orange-tanned and often gauche media mogul Silvio Berlusconi trod this trail long before Trump did. Berlusconi got pretty far too: Prime Minister Bunga Bunga took his own political party, Forza Italia (“Go, Italy!”), named for a popular football chant, to the record books, getting elected three times and becoming Italy’s longest-serving prime minister since World War II.Trump’s polarizing effect on the GOP has occurred against a backdrop of the similar splintering and polarization across Europe. Nationalists took power in Poland and made strides in French elections, for instance, while far-left parties gained votes in Spain and Greece — so America’s Trumpian trajectory seems par for the global course. Even so, Zublin says that while many young Europeans don’t think Trump will actually be elected, they’re worried about the pervasiveness of populist rhetoric; they believe it encourages hypernationalist thinking and allows people to become inured to racism, for example.Many in Israel are on the lookout for a stronger advocate than President Obama — perhaps Marco Rubio, with his vociferous pro-Israel stance. Certainly it’s early, so those who are paying attention are often following the primaries for their entertainment value. Which is high. When it comes to Trump, the consensus seems to be that his foreign-affairs policies aren’t well enough outlined — something that’s concerning to locals such as Opher Rom, a tour guide for celebrities when they visit Israel.Few of the names peppering the 2016 primaries are on the tips of everyday people’s tongues here. But two names are generating buzz, as Mumbai-based Sanjena Sathian has discovered. Hillary Clinton, with her familiar name, is the one many Indians figure will lead America. She’s perhaps not beloved but is certainly trusted. Yet Trump, inevitably, has burst out of U.S. borders and into the minds of locals here, perhaps confirming his constant assertion of the power of his surname. Many discuss Trump with an air of casual observation: He’s entertaining, maybe a bit threatening, but his presence doesn’t loom large here — yet. My fellow Canucks let out a collective sigh when Trump, during the latest GOP debate, dismissed the idea of building a wall between Canada and the U.S. — and instead doubled down on his pitch to erect a border along Mexico. Overall, a nationwide Insights West poll released last month found that 67 percent of Canadians say Trump would be “bad” for their country. And while Republican candidates normally fare well among conservative voters, Trump was regarded a poor choice by well over half of those who voted for our right-wing party in last year’s federal election.Meanwhile, our prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been asked about whether he’d condemn Trump’s hateful rhetoric — to which the Liberal Party leader first replied at a town hall hosted by Maclean’s that it would be “important for Canadians, for Canadian jobs, for Canadian prosperity, to be able to have a positive relationship with whoever Americans choose as their president.” Then came the “however,” where he added, “If we allow politicians to succeed by scaring people, we don’t actually end up any safer.”Still, that doesn’t mean we lost our sense of humor with the goings-on south of the border. The “Move to Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins” campaign, for one, has gained national attention — traction we haven’t seen since, well, Sarah Palin nearly became veep in ’08. *Nick Fouriezos, Laura Secorun Palet, Sanjena Sathian, Fiona Zublin, Libby Coleman, Leslie Nguyen-Okwu and Taylor Mayol contributed reporting.

Ted Cruz Probably Can’t Save The GOP Establishment From Donald Trump,578,"The GOP establishment seems convinced that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could stop the insurgent presidential front-runner Donald Trump, if only Ohio Gov. John Kasich would drop out and simplify the field. But polling suggests that even if Kasich were to suspend his campaign, Cruz’s support wouldn’t grow enough to stop Trump.According to a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday, Trump would defeat Cruz by a 9-point margin if the race were narrowed down to just the two of them. Forty-six percent of registered Republican voters would vote for Trump, the poll says, and 37 percent would vote for Cruz. Kasich doesn’t fare any better against Trump in a two-man scenario. Were Trump and Kasich to face off directly, 56 percent of GOP voters would vote for the real estate mogul and just 25 percent would vote for Kasich.  Probably the biggest obstacle to defeating Trump is his substantial delegate advantage. Trump currently leads the Republican field with 739 delegates to Cruz’s 465. In other words, Trump is 59 percent on his way to a nomination and Cruz is 38 percent of the way there.The current trajectory suggests it’s unlikely that any of the GOP candidates can win the 1,237 delegates it would take to capture the nomination by the time of the Republican National Convention in July.At this point, Trump is the only candidate who has a slim chance. And with several winner-take-all states ahead, Cruz can forget about winning the nomination unless he starts outperforming Trump. The only hope for Cruz now, and for the GOP establishment, is to pose enough of a challenge to Trump to ensure the race enters a contested convention. It’s even been suggested that it’s better for the #StopTrump movement if Kasich stays in the race. By remaining viable, Kasich could be gathering up delegates that Cruz would otherwise lose to Trump.  If the race does enter a contested convention, 6 in 10 Republicans say the candidate with the most delegates (likely to be Trump) should be nominated, according to a recent CNN poll. Even if Trump wins the nomination, the Quinnipiac poll suggests that he would lose in a general election (although it’s still too early to give much credence to general election polls). In fact, the only candidate who has broad enough support to defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a general election is the GOP’s lowest-polling candidate — Kasich.HuffPost pollster’s average of polls also shows Kasich as the only Republican candidate capable of defeating Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, in the general election. Both Cruz and Trump fall short. Unfortunately for Republicans, Kasich is the least likely candidate at this point to emerge as the nominee. "
Paul Ryan Criticizes The ‘Ugliness’ Of 2016 Politics,1806,"Assembled Wednesday in a committee room full of congressional interns — and reporters — House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) rebuked the disagreeable tone of politics in the 2016 race and even criticized his own use of divisive rhetoric in the past.From his familiar perch in the Ways and Means room, Ryan told the crowd of interns that, in this space, members used to hold themselves to a “higher standard of decorum.”“We treated each other with respect,” Ryan continued. “We disagreed — often fiercely so — but we disagreed without being disagreeable.”Ryan said he spoke in the past tense only because he no longer serves on the Ways and Means Committee. “But it almost sounds like I’m speaking of another time, doesn’t it?” he asked.Ryan’s entire speech was an indirect repudiation of the 2016 race. Without naming names — something he said he wouldn’t do during a question-and-answer session after the speech — the speaker didn’t leave much to the imagination as to whom he was most directly referring. He didn’t necessarily need to use the name Donald Trump for everyone to understand that he was talking about the GOP front-runner when he said “personalities come and go,” or that when someone has a bad idea, we should tell them, not “insult them into agreeing with us.”“We don’t shut down on people — and we don’t shut people down,” Ryan said.Democrats will almost certainly point out that Ryan continues to insist he will support the GOP nominee whoever he is, and that his latest “big speech,” as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s communications director Drew Hammill characterized it, “cannot distract from Republicans’ complete failure to pass a budget.”Still, the speech was surprising for how directly Ryan addressed the 2016 race. He said that “looking around at what’s taking place in politics today,” it’s easy to get “disheartened.”“How many of you find yourself just shaking your head at what you see from both sides?” he asked the crowd.“Our political discourse — both the kind we see on TV and the kind we experience among each other — did not use to be this bad and it does not have to be this way,” Ryan said.He continued that a little skepticism was healthy. “But when people distrust politics, they come to distrust institutions,” he said. “They lose faith in their government, and the future, too.”Ryan told the crowd of interns that they could acknowledge this, but they didn’t have to accept it — and they didn’t have to enable it.In many ways, Wednesday’s speech was Ryan’s most direct dip into the 2016 race so far. He has previously waded in twice to criticize Trump’s Muslim ban and the GOP front-runner’s less-than-emphatic disavowal of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke — again without using Trump’s name.After Ryan’s speech, his spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, “As chairman of the Republican National Convention, Speaker Ryan will preside and has to remain neutral on the presidential candidates.”But much of what Ryan said Wednesday could be used as an indictment of his own neutral strategy on Trump.“My dad used to always say, ‘You are either part of the problem, or you’re part of the solution,’” Ryan said.Ryan also reflected on some of his own divisive contributions to American politics. Specifically, Ryan criticized his use of the words “makers and takers” to describe people on government benefits, an admission he has made previously.“As I spent more time listening, and really learning the root causes of poverty, I realized something: I realized was wrong,” he said.Ryan said “takers” wasn’t how he wanted to refer to “a single mom stuck in a poverty trap, just trying to take care of her family.”“Most people don’t want to be dependent,” Ryan continued. “And to label a whole group of Americans that way was wrong.”He said he shouldn’t have castigated a large group of Americans to make a point. “So I stopped thinking about it that way — and I stopped talking about it that way.”During the question-and-answer session, Ryan also acknowledged that he had thought about criminal justice in the wrong way. He said Republicans and Democrats in the 1990s just thought they had to be tough on crime. Now, he wants to bring criminal justice reform bills coming out of the House Judiciary Committee to the House floor. “Redemption is a beautiful thing,” he said.Ryan said governing was never meant to be easy. “This has always been a tough business,” he said. “And when passions flare, ugliness is sometimes inevitable.”“But we shouldn’t accept ugliness as the norm,” he continued. “We should demand better from ourselves and from one another.”"
Bernie Sanders: Donald Trump Is Using Brussels To Attack All Muslims,2687,"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says Republican presidential front-runner and reality television star Donald Trump is using the tragedy in Brussels to incite bigotry against Muslims around the world.“I think people get afraid, and for good reasons,” Sanders said in a Tuesday evening interview with Jimmy Kimmel. “ISIS is a disgusting, barbaric organization. We’ve seen what they’ve done in Paris, what they’ve done in Brussels. People are afraid of an attack in the United States. But I think what we have to understand is we’re not going to undermine the Constitution of the United States of America in order to effectively destroy ISIS.”“At the end of the day, we cannot allow the Trumps of the world to use these incidents to attack all of the Muslim people in the world. That is unfair,” he added. “To imply that if somebody is a Muslim they’re a terrorist, that is an outrageous statement.”Trump called for closing U.S. borders on Tuesday, after a series of deadly terror attacks left dozens killed or wounded in Brussels.“We have to look at the mosques and study what’s going on. There is a sick problem going on,” Trump said in an interview with CBS News.Share this slide:"
HUFFPOLLSTER: Could The Attacks In Brussels Help Donald Trump In The Primary?,845,"The GOP trusts Donald Trump to handle terrorism, but the broader electorate trusts Hillary Clinton more. Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s positive campaign could win over voters — if they notice it. And Republicans aren’t changing their minds about Trump. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, March 23, 2016. CAN TRUMP CAPITALIZE ON ANTI-MUSLIM SENTIMENT? - Nate Silver: “Trump would ‘close up our borders’ in response to Brussels, he said...We might expect more rhetoric along these lines from Trump because the Paris and San Bernardino attacks appeared to boost his standing in national opinion polls, as well as the amount of media attention he received…. [T]he Paris and San Bernardino attacks were associated with an uptick in Trump’s numbers. According to our high-sensitivity polling average, Trump improved from 28 percent of the vote just before the Paris attacks to 32 percent on Dec. 1, the day before the San Bernardino attacks. His numbers then rose further, to about 35 percent by mid-December.” [538] Trump wasn’t the only candidate to rise in the polls - Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who’s staked his campaign less heavily on anti-Muslim rhetoric, also climbed in the polls in the same time period. Both candidates seem to have benefited from retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson’s collapse in the polls during that time. After the Paris attacks,Trump rose 4.8 percent in the HuffPost Pollster national GOP average and continued to rise throughout December. But Cruz also rose 3.3 percentage points and followed a similar trajectory. Both had already begun climbing since about the time Carson started dropping after a series of bad debate performances. Trump may well have benefitted from his tough stance, but it’s also possible he and Cruz were picking up Carson supporters.Clinton most trusted on terrorism - HuffPollster: “It’s too early to tell where public opinion will land after the latest bombings, but polls conducted since the Paris attack in November….show Americans tend to trust Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton more than other presidential candidates to handle [terrorism]....An ABC News/Washington Post poll in early March forced respondents to pick between the two presidential front-runners on who they think is best able to handle an international crisis and terrorism. Americans chose Clinton over Trump by a 29-point margin (61 percent to 32 percent) for an international crisis, and picked Clinton by a 14-point margin as the best to handle terrorism….According to exit polls from primary states that have already voted, Republicans placed the most faith — an average of 32 percent — in Trump to handle an international crisis.” [HuffPost]  WESTERN CONTESTS PLAY OUT AS ANTICIPATED - The votes aren’t all counted as of publication time, but primaries in Arizona and caucuses in Utah and Idaho have all been called for the winners. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton won Arizona by a nearly 20-point margin. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders grabbed  wins in Idaho and Utah, where it looks like he’ll end up with at least 50 point margins over Clinton. On the GOP side, Trump secured all of the delegates in the winner-take-all Arizona primary, beating Cruz by around 20 percentage points. But Cruz will win all of the delegates in the Utah caucus, where he finished well above the 50 percent winner-take-all threshold. The delegate race remains mostly the same for both parties after these contests: Clinton has a big lead over Sanders, and Trump still has a substantial lead over Cruz. [HuffPost]KASICH’S POSITIVE OUTLOOK COULD HELP HIM, IF HE GETS THE MESSAGE OUT - Lynn Vavreck - “His campaign has a notably positive tone and although Mr. Kasich trails his opponents in the delegate count, he continues to campaign  mainly on empowerment and experience—and there’s some evidence that people like it….[In]a virtual focus group….roughly 1,000 people were divided into four groups to watch and react to two political ads in real time.….Mr. Kasich’s ad left people somewhat happier and hopeful—and didn’t worry or anger them as much as Mr. Trump’s. They rated Mr. Kasich’s ad 10-points above the ‘average political ad’ in overall quality while placing Mr. Trump’s ad 5-points below the average ad…..On average, people rated Mr. Kasich’s ad as making them happy and hopeful—and as being higher in overall quality—and there’s some evidence to suggest that despite saying Mr. Trump’s ad was more memorable, Mr. Kasich’s empowering message moved people: among people who saw both ads relative to those who saw no ads at all, people increased their favorable ratings of Mr. Kasich by 11 points; Mr. Trump’s favorability, however, only increased by 3 points.” [Princeton University] Trump is still viewed favorably among Republicans - Frank Newport: “Republicans nationwide remain more positive than negative in their views of Donald Trump, with 55% viewing him favorably and 41% unfavorably so far in March. Despite Trump’s extraordinary journey since last summer as the central — and controversial — focus of the 2016 election, Republicans’ views of the billionaire businessman have generally held steady. His image today is roughly where it was last July….Since Trump’s favorable rating peaked at 61% in January, it has been lower each of the past two months. But from a broad perspective, the month-to-month changes have been relatively minor. The relative stability in Trump’s favorable percentage — ranging between 54% and 61% — shows that his supporters are fairly locked into their support and are not dramatically affected by what Trump says or does, or by what the media and rival candidates say about him. On a comparative basis, Trump’s popularity among Republicans is roughly similar to where Mitt Romney was in February 2012 (59% favorable, 31% unfavorable).” [Gallup]  Economic struggles and racial resentment both independently factor into Trump support - Max Ehrenfreund and Scott Clement: “The Post found that both economic troubles and feelings that whites are losing out have a strong – and independent – impact on Trump’s supporters….The analysis took both factors into account, and also controlled for demographics, income and political ideology….The odds that a person who feels strongly that whites are losing out supports Trump are more than three times higher than for a demographically and financially similar person who feels blacks or Hispanics are losing out or that neither group is losing out more. Likewise, the odds a person who says he or she is struggling financially supports Trump are about twice as high as someone who says he or she is comfortable or moving up economically.” [WashPost] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

"Hillary Clinton: Male Candidates Don’t Get Grief Over Smiling, Shouting",4688,"WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton responded Monday night to critics who have accused her of not smiling enough and shouting at campaign events.“Let me say, I don’t hear anybody say that about men,” Clinton told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “I’ve seen a lot of male candidates who don’t smile very much and who talk pretty loud. So I guess I’ll just leave it at that.”In fact, everyone on the campaign trail is loud and not especially smiley. That’s because they’re often yelling over screaming supporters at rallies and exhausted from traveling nonstop. Yet a number of male pundits have offered unsolicited advice to Clinton about the way she sounds and the way her face looks on the campaign trail. She’s noted the double standard.Cooper acknowledged Monday that he has seen male presidential candidates shouting at their events, to little fanfare.“Yeah,” Clinton replied. “There have been a few of those around.”Watch Clinton’s comments below:    Share this slide:"
"John Kasich, Ted Cruz Shoot Down Prospect Of Being Trump’s Vice President",546,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Monday ruled out the prospect of running for vice president on a ticket with real estate mogul Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.“There is zero chance that I’d be vice president with either of them,” Kasich said in an interview on CNN. “Below zero, actually. Not interested.”Asked the same question in a separate interview with CNN, Cruz also said he had “zero interest whatsoever” in being Trump’s vice president.Kasich argued he, not Trump or Cruz, was best positioned to take on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in November’s general election. He cited a recent CNN/ORC poll which showed Kasich topping both Clinton and her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a potential general election matchup.“You just read the polls. I’m the only one that wins the general,” Kasich said.Kasich faces extremely slim odds in his quest to win the necessary amount of delegates required to win his party’s nomination. His campaign has openly begun preparing for the prospect of a contested convention, a scenario in which no candidate reaches the required amount in the first ballot.“Nobody’s going to have the delegates they need going to the convention,” Kasich said on Sunday. “Everyone will fall short.”Some in his party, including former 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have begun pushing the governor to make an exit. The former Massachusetts governor recorded a robocall on behalf of Cruz on Monday that told voters in Utah that “a vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump.”Share this slide:"
Bernie Sanders Delivered A Killer AIPAC Speech ... In Utah,23405,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to speak at the country’s largest pro-Israel gathering in Washington on Monday. Instead, the Democratic presidential candidate, who is the only Jew in the race, gave a speech detailing his belief in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — in Utah.But then the speech he gave would have ruffled feathers before the approximately 18,000 attendees at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The people gathered at a high school in Salt Lake City were at least his supporters.AIPAC had invited Sanders and his rival for the Democratic nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to speak. The group also invited businessman Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the three remaining Republican presidential hopefuls.Sanders was the only candidate to decline the invitation, citing scheduled campaign events in Idaho, Utah and Arizona, which host their respective caucuses and primary on Tuesday. (He did request to address the conference remotely, which the group decided wasn’t kosher.)Presidential candidates who come to AIPAC tend to emphasize their “unwavering commitment” to Israel’s security, with some warm anecdotes thrown in about past visits to the country and how much they loved it. The candidates this year, including Clinton, spent a large portion of their speeches talking about the Iranian nuclear deal, which AIPAC had tried unsuccessfully to torpedo.Most White House hopefuls don’t say what Sanders did in Utah, which is that Israel’s government should get serious about a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“We are obligated to speak the truth as we see it, and that is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times,” Sanders said. “It is important among friends to be honest and truthful about differences we may have.”While Sanders declared his support for Israel’s continued existence as a Jewish state, he also talked about Palestinian unemployment and poverty.“When we talk about Israel and Palestinian areas, it is important to understand that today there is a whole lot of suffering among Palestinians and that cannot be ignored,” he said.Clinton had mentioned the sensitive issue of Israeli settlements just once in her speech to AIPAC on Monday morning. In contrast, Sanders spent significant time condemning construction of the settlements as counter-productive to the currently nonexistent peace process. He said that peace would require “compromises on both sides.”He called it “absurd for elements in [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s government to say that building more settlements in the West Bank is the appropriate response” to the most recent round of violence in the country. He argued that new settlement construction ultimately undermines Israeli security and predicted that Israel would have to pull back settlements in the West Bank, “just as it did in Gaza.” And he criticized Netanyahu’s government for withholding tax revenue it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. This is a stronger position against settlements than that of most American political leaders, who talk about Israel swapping land with the Palestinians to compensate for some large settlement blocs in the West Bank that most assume would remain in Israel’s control under a two-state solution.Sanders did not explicitly lay out the parameters for what a two-state solution should look like. But he said that Hamas and Hezbollah would have to “renounce efforts” to undermine Israel’s security and that he’d require “the entire world” to recognize Israel’s right to exist. He also said that Israelis should feel secure from violence and terrorism, while Palestinians should have self-determination and civil rights. He argued in favor of ending the economic blockade of Gaza.The senator implicitly criticized AIPAC for lobbying against the Iran nuclear agreement last year.“I do not accept the idea that the pro-Israel position was to oppose the deal,” he said. “Preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon will strengthen not only America’s security, but Israel’s security as well.”In yet another line that presidential candidates don’t tend to take before the AIPAC crowd, Sanders called on Israel to end “disproportionate responses” to attacks — though he said any attack launched against Israel is “unacceptable.”Sanders condemned indiscriminate rocket fire from Hamas into Israel proper. But he also mentioned that he had spoken out “strongly against the Israeli counter-attacks that killed nearly 1,500 civilians and wounded thousands more” when Israel responded to rocket attacks by invading Gaza in 2014.“It is clear to me that the path to peace will require tapping into our shared humanity to make hard but just decisions,” he said, concluding the Israel-related section of a speech that also touched on the self-described Islamic State and civil war in Syria.Sanders’ speech would have made quite a statement at AIPAC, which places more of an emphasis on American-Israeli security cooperation and ignores the settlements issue.But he didn’t seem to want even his supporters to know he was giving a speech on foreign policy, although he had long promised one. His campaign tweeted about it just once while he was delivering his remarks, after sending a link to watch it live.Share this slide:"
Hillary Clinton Lays Out Her Own Middle East Approach — And It’s Not Obama’s,7730,"WASHINGTON — After her landslide loss in the New Hampshire primary last month, Hillary Clinton responded by tying herself tightly to President Barack Obama and slamming her opponent, Bernie Sanders, for past criticism of the president. That embrace, though, has not extended beyond U.S. shores. On Monday, Clinton used her speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to continue to lay down a foreign policy vision starkly at odds with the Obama doctrine of restraint and retrenchment. Clinton sent a clear signal: Her presidency would replace reluctance to intervene and get bogged down in Middle East conflicts with a hawkish approach — one her aides have previously asked reporters to describe as “muscular.”Clinton, in her AIPAC speech, repeated and, in some cases, put a finer point on arguments she advancced in the fall at a major Brookings Institute speech, and in December at the Saban Forum. But set against the backdrop of a recent profile of Obama’s foreign policy doctrine by The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, as well as the decision by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to skip AIPAC’s gathering while Obama traveled to Cuba, the daylight between the world views of Clinton and Obama was that much more apparent. Obama, as described by Goldberg, has attempted to pull the U.S. back from unwinnable conflicts in the Middle East, and has criticized a shoot-first mentality in Washington’s foreign policy network. He doesn’t seem to have won over Clinton. “Obama’s goal of ‘ending the mindset’ that got us into Iraq inspired a lot of progressives,” said Matt Duss, a foreign policy analyst at the progressive Foundation for Middle East Peace. “Apart from support for the Iran agreement, I didn’t hear anything from Clinton that suggests that she sees that mindset as a problem.” Clinton, without naming the president, tweaked Obama for his strained relationship with Netanyahu. “One of the first things I’ll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House,” she offered to raucous applause.“She’s been very clearly laying out her own thinking. And she’s laid out some very, very clear principles that are orienting for her view of how we approach the Middle East,” said a Clinton aide who was involved in the speech preparation and requested anonymity to give background about the talk.The aide added that progressives concerned about the hawkish tone should remember that Clinton has been a staunch advocate of diplomacy, noting her support for the Iran deal, which Clinton helped launch through back channels; her backing of a political transition in Syria; and “supporting a two-state solution and needing to take steps that encourage that ultimate outcome.”“The other thing I’d point [progressive critics] to is her emphasis on the values that underpin both why the U.S.-Israel relationship is so important, but also a real part of our global leadership,” the aide said. “That is also a really important point for those who try to paint her as a hawk — they are ignoring how much work she’s done on behalf of — whether it’s on women’s rights or gay rights or development — and really ensuring that those are core parts of our approach to foreign policy and a key element of our national security.”The outreach to Netanyahu, though, comes after he has been as aggressively opposed to Obama as any Israeli leader has been to a U.S. president in the history of the relationship between the two countries. Netanyahu actively rooted against Obama’s re-election in 2012 and lobbied relentlessly against the president’s Iran nuclear deal, going so far as to address Congress. Clinton on Monday suggested there would be no cost for such a move against a U.S. president, a signal she may come to regret if she becomes one herself.Clinton’s one half-phrase of criticism was couched in a grammatically awkward construction that served to obscure its target, and was followed by an applause line.“Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear — I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council,” Clinton said, the only mention of Israel’s settlement policy, which violates international law, followed quickly by a promise to block the U.N. from moving the peace process forward, as Secretary of State John Kerry and European leaders are attempting to do.“Clinton has struggled hard with the progressive base because of her vote for the Iraq war, but I think a lot of voters would be willing to forgive that vote if they thought she really understood why it was a strategic mistake, and not just a political one. I don’t think today’s speech allayed those concerns,” said Duss. Sanders, who has mostly ignored foreign policy to focus on economic inequality, decided to skip AIPAC, leaving the stage to Clinton and, later Monday, to Donald Trump. Instead, in Utah, Sanders delivered a speech that would have left the AIPAC crowd as silent as they were when Clinton praised the Iran deal.Clinton also put the blame for the non-existence of peace talks squarely with the Palestinians. “It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists,” Clinton said, neglecting to mention that Netanyahu himself is not a willing partner and has explicitly and repeatedly said that he is not open to a Palestinian state.Elsewhere in the speech, Clinton aimed bellicose language at Iran, promising more sanctions and an aggressive regime of oversight of the nuclear deal. She also damned the growing Boycott, Sanctions and Divestment movement, sidestepping the fact that some recent legislation targeting the movement includes language that also protects Israeli businesses operating in illegal settlements. Unmentioned was any Palestinian suffering under the endless military occupation.  The best hope for progressives, though, is that Clinton didn’t mean any of it. When candidate Barack Obama came to AIPAC in 2008, he used similarly tough rhetoric. With Sanders in her rearview mirror, Clinton had little to gain politically from confronting AIPAC, and much to lose.But that’s not the case, said the Clinton aide. “This is all consistent with what she’s been saying for awhile, but some are hearing it differently now,” said the aide. “This is all very, very consistent with her long-held views.”Indeed, the remarks do fit her general foreign policy philosophy, suggesting her vote for war in Iraq was not a mistake made of political expediency, but flowed from a consistently interventionist mindset. Obama has described his foreign policy as being rooted in the idea that the U.S. should avoid doing “stupid shit.” Clinton has disagreed, saying privately that “great nations need organizing principles, and ?‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle.” She quickly apologized for that one, as she has apologized for her Iraq war vote. But she also condemned Obama privately for failing to attack Syria after it crossed his “red line.”“If you say you’re going to strike, you have to strike. There’s no choice,” Clinton said immediately after, according to Goldberg, who also reported Obama’s private retort to the argument: “Dropping bombs on someone to prove that you’re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.”"
7 Brutal Yet Thoughtful Takedowns Of Donald Trump,2073,"As the prospect of Donald Trump being the Republican nominee becomes increasingly likely, many of the media’s most prominent voices are warning that the brash businessman poses a bona fide threat to American values. Here are seven columns that take aim at the Trump machine, strongly and carefully making the case that the GOP front-runner is not fit for the presidency. All of these pieces reach a similar conclusion: Trump’s rise, once an entertaining sideshow not to be taken seriously, is now very real, and very scary. David Brooks, The New York Times“Donald Trump is an affront to basic standards of honesty, virtue and citizenship. He pollutes the atmosphere in which our children are raised. He has already shredded the unspoken rules of political civility that make conversation possible. In his savage regime, public life is just a dog-eat-dog war of all against all.” David Remnick, The New Yorker“Trump is no longer hustling golf courses, fake ‘universities,’ or reality TV. He means to command the United States armed forces and control its nuclear codes. He intends to propose legislation, conduct America’s global affairs, preside over its national-intelligence apparatus, and make the innumerable moral and political decisions required of a President. This is not a Seth Rogen movie; this is as real as mud.” Martin Wolf, Financial Times“It is rash to assume constitutional constraints would survive the presidency of someone elected because he neither understands nor believes in them. Rounding up and deporting 11 [million] people is an immense coercive enterprise. Would a president elected to achieve this be prevented and, if so, by whom? What are we to make of Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm for the barbarities of torture? Would he find people willing to carry out his desires or not?”Ezra Klein, Vox“It is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump. He’s red-faced, discursive, funny, angry, strange, unpredictable, and real. He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon. The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id. America’s most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we’ve ever seen.It’s so fun to watch that it’s easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is.” Los Angeles Times editorial board“The reality is that Trump has no experience whatsoever in government, interacting with the machinery of state only as a supplicant. He has shamefully little knowledge of the issues facing the country and the world, and a temperament utterly unsuited to the job. He is a racist and a bully, a demagogue.”Peter Wehner, The New York Times“The founders, knowing history and human nature, took great care to devise a system that would prevent demagogues and those with authoritarian tendencies from rising up in America. That system has been extraordinarily successful. We have never before faced the prospect of a political strongman becoming president. Until now.”The Economist“The things Mr. Trump has said in this campaign make him unworthy of leading one of the world’s great political parties, let alone America. One way to judge politicians is by whether they appeal to our better natures: Mr. Trump has prospered by inciting hatred and violence. He is so unpredictable that the thought of him anywhere near high office is terrifying. He must be stopped.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Bernie Sanders Wins Hawaii Democratic Caucus,14638,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) defeated Hillary Clinton in Saturday’s Hawaii Democratic caucus, known locally as a “presidential preference poll.”The Aloha State, considered among the bluest of the blue in the country, sends a total of 34 delegates — 25 proportionately allotted and nine superdelegates — to the Democratic National Convention.Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in Washington state and Alaska on Saturday as well.Ahead of the Hawaii caucus, Clinton garnered support from the majority of Hawaii’s Democratic political force, including Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz, Rep. K. Mark Takai, and a number of state legislators and former governors. In a statement last week, Schatz said Clinton was the right choice because of her record of addressing climate change, protecting the environment and promoting clean energy, all of which are priorities for the island state.In February, however, Sanders received a key endorsement from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who resigned from her post as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to support the senator’s presidential bid.Gabbard, a veteran, said in a video announcing her endorsement that Sanders would “usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.”“We need a commander in chief who has foresight, who exercises good judgment and who understands the need for a robust foreign policy which defends the safety and security of the American people,” Gabbard said. “And who will not waste precious lives and money on interventionist wars of regime change.”Neither Clinton nor Sanders campaigned in Hawaii before Saturday’s caucus. Sanders’ wife, Jane, however, toured the state this week, with stops on Oahu and Maui.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who dropped out of the presidential race last month, and San Diego businessman and real estate tycoon Roque “Rocky” De La Fuente, who has launched a presidential bid, also appeared on ballot. According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, some 37,000 people voted in Hawaii’s Democratic presidential preference poll in 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama, who was born in Hawai was seeking the party’s nomination.Hawaii’s Republican caucus was held March 8 and drew approximately 15,600 voters. Candidate Donald Trump won with 43 percent of the vote and accounted for 11 of Hawaii’s 19 Republican delegates.Share this slide:"
Donald Trump’s First Major Foreign Policy Speech Is Completely Devoid Of Substance,5349,"WASHINGTON — Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump promised 18,000 attendees at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual conference Monday evening that he wouldn’t pander to them about Israel. “That’s what politicians do. All talk, no action,” Trump told the pro-Israel lobbying group.Then he spent the next 25 minutes pandering to Israel. The real estate tycoon offered the usual Republican Party bromides: The Iran nuclear deal was terrible, the United Nations was an anti-Israel joke, and the Palestinians were to blame for the failure to reach a two-state solution. But what set him apart from other presidential hopefuls, who aren’t rhetorically all that different, was the shallowness of his pander. Listing various failed efforts at reaching a two-state solution, Trump sounded as if he was reading an abridged version of the Wikipedia page on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The speech was billed as the self-proclaimed billionaire’s first scripted, focused foreign policy address, coming hours after he revealed his foreign policy team, which includes a former Blackwater executive and a former adviser to a Lebanese warlord. In a shift from his usual meandering, unscripted riffs, Trump largely adhered to the pre-drafted speech his campaign released in advance — with the exception of a dozen repetitions of “believe me,” apparently added to emphasize the trueness of his commitment. And while he managed not to drift into blanket denigrations of any gender, nationality or religion, his speech was largely a list of problems facing Israel, an insistence that President Barack Obama is to blame, and a promise to solve everything. He didn’t explain how he would do so. It was a speech just unsophisticated enough to inspire bipartisan shoulder-shrugging. “It was really a recitation of canned Republican talking points, designed to get applause from the crowd he was talking to,” Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal pro-Israel group, J Street, said after the speech. “As a policy speech, it’s meaningless,” conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, a Trump critic, said on Fox News. “I don’t think it gives you any idea of what he would do as president.”Indeed, if a Trump doctrine emerged from the AIPAC address, it was to trust in Trump. He said he earned his chops by agreeing to march in the Salute to Israel Parade in 2004 in New York as the grand marshal. “It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly for anyone supporting Israel — many people turned down this honor. I did not, I took the risk,” Trump said. And on Monday, he asked attendees to give him a chance to reshape the Middle East.On Iran, Trump said his first priority is to “dismantle” the deal that has downsized Iran’s nuclear infrastructure to the point where it incapable of producing a nuclear weapon, reversing his earlier calls to strictly enforce the nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S., and other nations. But he didn’t explain what he would do to prevent Iranians from moving to acquire a nuclear weapon in the absence of the international agreement. And later in the speech, he went off script and said, “We will enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me.” On issue of confronting Iran’s support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, Trump’s prescription was comforting, perhaps, but comically simplistic. “We will totally dismantle Iran’s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us … We will work to dismantle that reach,” he assured the crowd, adding, “believe me, believe me.” On the stalled peace process between Israelis and Palestinians — a complex geopolitical crisis with inflamed religious tensions and a long history of bloodshed that has vexed numerous presidents — Trump’s recipe for a breakthrough was his own strategic brilliance. “Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate,” he explained. “Each side must give up something.” But aside from boasting about his book Trump: The Art of the Deal, he gave no explanation how he would broker a compromise. His only concrete proposal on how he would advance a two-state solution is to use American veto power at the United Nations Security Council “100 percent”  to block any resolution that lays out the parameters for an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.Though Trump’s speech was vague enough to confuse, his mere appearance was enough to offend some. Just before he took the stage, several rabbis stood up and silently exited the massive Verizon Center sports arena, congregating outside to study Jewish texts about human dignity. “This particular candidate has crossed such lines of bigotry, racism, and xenophobia, of misogyny, that are out of bounds,” said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, who was among the rabbis who walked out. “He’s legitimating hate. And we are the Jews … who have the memory of the Holocaust and the memory of the refugee experience. We can’t stand idly by.” Pesner, like other objecting rabbis, insisted his gripe is with Trump, not AIPAC, which, as a lobbying organization, has reason to nurture ties with anyone who could be the next president. (The group made an exception in 2012, when it did not invite GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul because of his opposition to foreign aid to Israel.) Others, however, said the organization did a disservice by allowing Trump to speak. “Over the last few months, Trump has preyed on people’s fear and anger, pointing the finger at different groups, whether it be Latinos, Muslims, or women across the United States,” said Ethan Miller, a spokesman for If If Not Now, a Jewish group that organized a protest against Trump and AIPAC’s decision to host him. “As Jews, we know the consequences of blaming one group for the ills of society — the fact that AIPAC was welcoming him with open arms, we knew we had to speak up and make sure our voices are heard too.”Stephen Spitz, a 69-year-old Jewish man based in Virginia, tagged along with the If Not Now protesters carrying a sign of his own, which read, “Love Trumps Hate,” a quote he attributed to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential candidate. “That is anathema — should be anathema — to any American who understands what this country was based on. It doesn’t matter what the religion, once you go down that road, you change the whole nature of the country,” Spitz said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
Donald Trump Is Wrong On How Many Delegates He Needs To Win,845,"Donald Trump, the GOP’s presidential front-runner, needs a lesson in party rules. He seems to think that if he repeatedly insists that he should win the nomination if he ends up with the most delegates among the remaining contenders, it will be true.But that’s where his political inexperience is showing. The Republican Party’s nomination process just doesn’t work like that, and saying otherwise a thousand times won’t make it so. Threatening that there will be riots won’t help him either (we hope).In order to win the GOP nomination, Trump needs a majority of the delegates — that means 50 percent plus one — not just “the most” delegates. (That’s also how it works with the Democratic Party.)The Republicans’ nomination rulebook states quite clearly, “There are 2,472 delegates to the 2016 Republican National Convention. Therefore, 1,237 delegates are currently required to secure the Republican nomination for President of the United States outright.”If a candidate secures those 1,237 delegates through the primary and caucus process that occurs in the states prior to the convention, great! That person becomes the presumptive nominee — meaning that it’s assumed that person will receive the majority vote of the delegates at the convention on the first ballot. The delegates still vote, but the convention is mostly a coronation.What Trump is describing in his statements is a situation in which no candidate gets to the 1,237 threshold through the earlier state-by-state processes. That’s a real possibility this year. What happens at that point gets complicated, but the party rules are clear on the need for a majority of the delegates:“If no candidate shall have received such majority, the chairman of the convention shall direct the roll of the states be called again and shall repeat the calling of the roll until a candidate shall have received a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the convention.”They vote again and again until someone gets a majority.If Trump doesn’t have a majority going into the convention, he will have to try to sway additional delegates to support him. Many delegates become “unbound,” or free, from their candidates after the first vote. So that means Trump could try to pick up other candidates’ delegates, but other candidates will be doing the same with his delegates. And that’s fair, despite what Trump is suggesting.GOP history does not oblige delegates to clear the path for any front-runner, either. In 1920 and 1940, Republicans chose “dark horses,” i.e., nominees who weren’t even among the leading candidates going into the convention. A rule adopted in 2012 likely means the 2016 convention won’t be that exciting: It requires that any candidate for the nomination must have the support of a majority of delegates from at least eight states. But it’s unclear how this provision would work in a contested convention.So no, it’s not enough to have more delegates than anyone else. The rules say the nominee has to win the majority. Only tyrants trample the rules, Mr. Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
"Burt Reynolds Likes Donald Trump, But Thinks Angelina Jolie Would Be A Better President",70,"Now that we know how “totally zonkered”  Burt Reynolds was when he shot his infamous Cosmopolitan spread, it’s time to check back in with the Bandit about the fate of our country. In fact, we probably should have consulted with him sooner. “I don’t think there’s any question that Donald is going to be nominated,” Reynolds, who identifies as neither a Republican nor a Democrat, told The Daily Beast in an exclusive interview. “You know, our current president has kind of messed things up the last four years. But I don’t know who I would vote for.”Reynolds’ support for Trump has a complicated backstory, however, as both were heavily involved with the ill-fated United States Football League in the ‘80s. The actor, who co-owned the Tampa Bay Bandits (?? ) blames the downfall of the USFL on Trump’s “personal ambitions.” Yup, sounds about right! “I’m worried about Donald in terms of us getting into a war, because he’s all for certain things,” Reynolds explained. “I like him very much personally. I know him, and I like him. He’s always been nice and sweet and kind to me. But he seems to be like a sheriff that’s quick on the draw.”In his eyes, there’s only one man he’d endorse for president: Jon Voight. Talk about a twist, right? Describing the actor as “an answer to our problems,” Reynolds goes on to hardcore stan for Voight for Prez 2016. “If any actor was going to run for office, it should be Jon Voight,” Reynolds remarked. “I think he’s quite brilliant in terms of handling himself and he always knows what’s going on in politics.” But according to Reynolds, Voight “gets red in the face” when a potential candidacy is mentioned, so he has another option in mind: Angelina Jolie. “It’s Jon Voight’s daughter that should run,” he said laughing according to The Daily Beast. “I like her a lot. She’s not afraid to tackle anything, and she’s a very, very sweet girl.”We don’t know about “sweet,” but yes, Angie gets stuff done. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Bernie Sanders Wins Idaho Democratic Caucus,5906,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) solidly defeated Hillary Clinton in Idaho’s Democratic caucus on Tuesday.He walked away with 78 percent of the vote, compared to Clinton’s 21 percent. That gives him 17 delegates. Clinton picks up six.There was record-breaking turnout in the deeply red state, with some waiting in line for hours to vote. It was clear who many Democratic voters were there for; a CNN reporter on the scene in Boise late Tuesday was regularly greeted with cheers of “Bernie!” as the camera panned the scene.Sanders had a slight lead heading into the caucus, and unlike Clinton, he spent time in the state. He drew thousands of supporters at an Idaho Falls event on Friday, and held another event Monday at Boise State University. Clinton opted to send in a surrogate, Olympic silver medalist Michelle Kwan, to rally supporters at the school on Thursday. Kwan previously worked as a public envoy under Clinton at the State Department.Despite Sanders’ romp, one thing remains the same in the Democratic race: Clinton is dominating. She swept in last week’s key primaries in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina, and by the end of Tuesday — Utah’s caucus and Arizona’s primary were also that day — Clinton’s total number of pledged delegates stood at 1,214 to Sanders’ 901. It takes 2,383 delegates to lock in the nomination.It’s nearly impossible for Sanders to win at this point, mathematically speaking. As Vox points out, he would have to prevail in practically every remaining state by huge margins in order to catch up to Clinton’s pledged delegates.The next Democratic primaries are on Saturday, in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state.This article has been updated to indicate that Bernie Sanders won by a wide margin.CORRECTION: This article originally said Michelle Kwan was an Olympic gold medalist. She is a silver medalist. Share this slide:"
Elizabeth Warren: ‘Donald Trump Is A Loser’,10885,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tore into Donald Trump on Monday, turning the Republican presidential front-runner’s favorite insult against him.“Let’s be honest — Donald Trump is a loser,” Warren wrote in a Facebook post, noting his failed business ventures and bankruptcies as well as the ongoing fraud lawsuit against Trump University.However, Warren warned, it’s important to take Trump seriously.“Many of history’s worst authoritarians started out as losers — and Trump is a serious threat,” she wrote. “The way I see it, it’s our job to make sure he ends this campaign every bit the loser he started it.”Several hours after her Facebook post, Warren continued to make the case against Trump on Twitter: While Warren has not endorsed in the Democratic primary, the progressive senator has strongly condemned Trump — and the Republican Party for enabling his dominance in the race. Last week, she urged “decent people everywhere“ to stand up to Trump, arguing the businessman is a “bigger, uglier threat every day that goes by.” And in an interview with MSNBC earlier this month, she argued the GOP only has itself to blame for Trump’s rise. “They are paying the price for their own extremism. It has now taken them by the throat,” she said of the Republican Party. “Guys, this is what you did to yourselves.”UPDATE, 3:01 p.m. ET: When asked about Warren’s comments, Trump referred to Warren as “the Indian,” an apparent reference to a 2012 controversy over Warren’s Native American heritage.  Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.This story has been updated to include Warren’s later tweets.Share this slide:"
Hillary Clinton Is Actually Doing Better With Small Donors,,"WASHINGTON — Amid the first primary and caucus contests for the Democratic presidential nomination last month, Hillary Clinton added a new line to her regular stump speech, thanking the many small donors fueling her campaign.The line was almost a direct copy from the speeches given by her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It also appeared to be contradicted by the fact that she had only received 18 percent of her funds from donors giving $200 or below. But Clinton’s campaign actually did far better among small donors in February than any previous month. According to a new campaign report filed on Sunday, the Clinton campaign raised $10.5 million from small donors, which made up one-third of all contributions. The total includes contributions to Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee linked to the campaign, that have been either transferred to or spent on behalf of the candidate.The February small-donor haul was a huge improvement for Clinton. She only raised $19 million from small donors in all of 2015 and added another $4.2 million in January. It was also probably a necessary fundraising change as her campaign leaned far too heavily on donors giving the maximum $2,700 in 2015. A heavy reliance on maximum donors is problematic because they cannot give anymore to fund a long primary slog. The campaign can keep tapping a large pool of small donors for money long into both a primary and general election campaign. Her campaign touted the milestone of receiving 1 million individual donors on March 18. The Sanders campaign, however, is approaching the 2 million mark.While Clinton is seeing vastly improving small-donor numbers, the Sanders camp’s almost complete reliance on small donors is unprecedented. The Vermont senator has raised nearly $140 million through February, with two-thirds coming from small donors.Overall, Sanders raised $43 million in February to Clinton’s $32 million (which includes Victory Fund allocations). Both campaigns kept their burn rate — the rate at which the campaign spends the money it raises —  just below 100 percent that month. Share this slide:"
It’s Time For Presidential Candidates To Talk About The New Housing Crisis,764,"In the fall, seven presidential candidates showed up at a New Hampshire housing summit to hear about the affordable housing crisis affecting millions of Americans, and organizers deemed the event a success. But all seven have dropped out of the race, and there has been little acknowledgement of housing issues since.Homeownership declined to a record low following the foreclosure crisis, and there are 9 million more renters now than there were a decade ago. Rent prices continue to go up, pushing homeownership further out of reach for some. Nearly half of renters are “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. Cost burdens are increasingly affecting middle-class families.The struggle to find a decent place to live is integral to the economic issues candidates highlight, but it has hardly been mentioned this election cycle.The October event in New Hampshire was sponsored by the J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America’s Families, a bipartisan nonprofit founded last year to end that silence. Board members include former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and Henry Cisneros, who was secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton. The foundation has met with candidates and their teams to push them to tackle the housing crisis, said foundation president Pamela Patenaude. “Our number one goal is to elevate housing into the national policy dialogue and to educate the candidates about the need to address housing as a domestic policy issue that’s often forgotten during presidential campaigns,” Patenaude said. Matthew Desmond, a Harvard University sociologist whose research on eviction shows how housing struggles push low-income families further into poverty, said the “good news” is that candidates on both sides of the aisle are talking about inequality.“Work is central to this problem, but it’s only part of the solution,” Desmond said. “I’d like candidates to recognize that the lack of affordable housing, the extreme rent-burden low-income families are facing, is a wellspring for all sorts of social problems, from residential instability, to kids not being able to finish school, health and depression issues, moving into bad neighborhoods — housing is central to the story, and I think that we need a very bold and robust housing platform that matches the size and scale of the problem.”“We can’t fix poverty in America without fixing housing,” he added. Some attention was drawn to the issue at a Democratic town hall in Las Vegas last month, when Hillary Clinton fielded a question about Hispanic Americans struggling to own homes after the recession.“I want us to move in any way we can in the federal government to help relieve the burden of already existing homeowners,” she said. “Secondly, we want to provide more help so that more homeowners, Hispanic homeowners, African-American homeowners, those who want to be, have access to better credit, and better support.”Clinton is the only candidate who has issued a specific housing plan, Patenaude said.The candidate’s economic agenda aimed at poor and minority communities calls for a $25 billion investment in housing. She lists several programs to expand access to homeownership and address the “skyrocketing rise of rental costs.” Urban planner Robert Silverman, from the State University of New York at Buffalo, praised Clinton’s platform for linking housing with employment and education.You can find clips of Democratic challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) talking about the burden of high rents for poor families or highlighting the ongoing consequences of the foreclosure crisis in a campaign ad. Patenaude noted that even though Sanders hasn’t issued policy suggestions, he has a solid background in affordable housing, going back to his time as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in the 1980s. In Congress, he has pushed for a national housing trust fund and supported housing assistance programs. Republican candidates have said little, if anything at all, about affordable housing. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hasn’t addressed the issue head-on, but his policy proposals would affect housing: His plan to eliminate HUD would pose a risk to critical housing assistance programs.Candidates’ inattention could be a missed opportunity, public policy professor and Terwilliger Foundation board member Raphael Bostic wrote in January: The federal government has tremendous influence over housing policy, from tax incentives to HUD programs to oversight of the secondary market. The presidential candidates face a choice. They can view these policies as tools and craft an affordable, sustainable housing strategy that heals some of the deepest rifts in our economy and our society. Or they can bury their head in the sand and ignore the centerpiece of our middle-class wealth and the beating heart of our banking system.There’s some evidence that voters would prefer the former. In a telephone poll of 820 New Hampshire residents, conducted for the foundation by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center last fall, 75 percent said presidential candidates should put some focus on housing affordability, and 35 percent said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate with a housing plan.Patenaude said the foundation has tried to submit questions about affordable housing for each debate, and while she’s disappointed they’ve struck out so far, she’s optimistic about the possibility of having their questions addressed during the general election. The organization is still meeting with candidates and drafting specific policy recommendations to present at each party’s convention.“If we can get the candidates to talk about it during the campaign season, then that’s a guarantee that they have to address it when they get elected,” she said._____Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.

HUFFPOLLSTER: Prediction Markets Give Democrats A 72 Percent Chance Of Keeping The White House,4433,"Political betting markets and polls both give Democrats a big advantage in November, but it’s still early to predict what will happen. Americans with bleaker economic outlooks are more likely to support Trump. And AP-GfK is testing online exit polls. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 18, 2016. PREDICTION MARKETS FAVOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IN NOVEMBER- David Rothschild: “The 10 March 15 primaries (five Democratic and five Republican) went just as expected, if you were following the prediction markets. On prediction markets around the world, people bought and sold contracts on any candidate winning...These contract prices are aggregated on my website, PredictWise.com, and turned into probabilities of any candidate winning any election….After Trump’s and Clinton’s strong showing on March 15, the markets predicted that the eventual Democratic nominee will win, at a probability of 72 percent….Here’s another point of reference. At this point in the 2012 presidential race, Barack Obama running for reelection was valued at a 60 percent likelihood to win….For March 16 of an election year, 72 percent is a very high probability of winning.” [WashPost]Not that different from what polls are showing - Polling on hypothetical general election matchups shows similar results: The Democratic candidate — whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders — polls ahead of the most likely Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Clinton leads Trump by 8 points in the HuffPost Pollster model and Sanders leads by 11 points. Both Democrats lead over Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) as well, but by smaller margins. There hasn’t been much polling of Ohio Gov. John Kasich against the Democrats, but he is the only Republican candidate to lead. However, these polling matchups should be viewed with caution.. Candidates will face more scrutiny and criticism in the general election campaign, and voters will be paying more attention in the fall. At this point, the results are not predictive of what would happen in November.ECONOMIC STRUGGLES HELP EXPLAIN TRUMP’S POPULARITY - John Sides: “[P]olitical scientist Phillip Converse….found that people’s opinions of the parties and candidates were often based on how well things were going in the country. ….These are exactly the kind of voters who are supporting Trump... ‘Our country doesn’t win anymore’ and ‘Make America great again’ are refrains that tell voters that times are bad….It’s not surprising, then, that Trump’s support is strongest among those who are struggling….YouGov/Economist polls show that Trump’s gains among Republicans were larger among those who reported that their personal finances had gotten worse, compared to those whose finances had gotten better. The gap is now roughly 20 percentage points….Trump did about 30 points better among those who, almost one year earlier, were the most dissatisfied with their situation, compared to those who were the most satisfied.” [WashPost] Americans have mixed opinions on candidates’ tax proposals - Frank Newport: “Almost two-thirds of Americans agree with the idea of closing loopholes and removing deductions ‘available to the very rich’...Overall, broad plans to cut taxes for all income levels (part of Trump’s plan) and to reduce the current complex system to a simple 10% flat tax (Cruz’s proposal) are by no means big winners...Trump’s idea of simplifying the tax code into four brackets, rather than the current seven, receives about four times as much support as opposition — 47% vs. 12% — but 41% of Americans, the highest for any proposal tested, say they don’t know enough about it to have an opinion.“ [Gallup] AP RELEASES RESULTS OF ONLINE ELECTION POLL TESTS - Paul Colford: “With a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation , AP hired GfK Custom Research to conduct an experiment with online surveys during last fall’s general elections in Kentucky and Mississippi… AP wanted to know if the online methodology could provide accurate and timely estimates of candidate vote percentages in small states that are difficult to poll with traditional methods.The GfK survey had the correct winner in all seven statewide races polled in the two states, including the Kentucky governor’s race. Pre-election polls had predicted a win for Democrat Jack Conway, but he ended up losing to Republican Matt Bevin by almost 9 percentage points. The GfK online survey had Bevin winning by just under 5 points. Overall, the online poll had an average error of 3 percentage points on candidate estimates across seven statewide races….Online panel estimates of candidate vote percentages in the gubernatorial and senatorial races in each of those states proved to be much more accurate than exit poll estimates.” [AP] Building on earlier tests - More from Colford: “The surveys in Kentucky and Mississippi built on experiments GfK conducted for the AP in Georgia and Illinois during the 2014 general election. Online panel estimates of candidate vote percentages in the gubernatorial and senatorial races in each of those states proved to be much more accurate than exit poll estimates. In Georgia, for example, a combined exit poll of Election Day voters and a telephone poll of absentee/early voters had Democratic winners in three of the four races. The online panel estimates correctly predicted Republican wins in all three races.” [AP] WHY CAMPAIGNS NEED TO TRUST POLLSTERS - David Mowery: Polling, we’re told, is now in a state of perpetual crisis….Why, then, do campaigns of all sizes and candidates at every level listen to what public and private polling has to say? Why are the top pollsters still renowned as gurus? The collective schizophrenia around polling can seem perplexing, but it’s actually fairly simple. Unlike man, all polls are not created equal....What I can say about getting accurate results ...is that to get good results you have to be willing to pay what might seem like astronomical amounts of money….You also have to be willing to keep your length down, your sample size up, and avoid split testing as much as possible….You have to define your objectives up front, and be willing to make hard decisions about what to test and what to leave out. That’s where trust in your pollster is key.” [Campaigns and Elections]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

The Conservative Anti-Trump Strategy Is Taking Shape,2145,"A coalition of conservatives opposing Donald Trump’s presidential campaign called for a Republican unity ticket in a statement issued Thursday. The “Statement From Conservatives Against Trump,” published by The Resurgent’s Erick Erickson, marks a new phase in conservative efforts to deny the GOP frontrunner the party’s nomination.“We call for a unity ticket that unites the Republican Party,” said the group, which met Thursday at the Army Navy Club in Washington. Attendees at the meeting included former George W. Bush adviser Bill Wichterman and Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), a vocal supporter of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Erickson, who participated by phone, later issued a statement on behalf of the group. “We believe that the issue of Donald Trump is greater than an issue of party. It is an issue of morals and character that all Americans, not just those of us in the conservative movement, must confront,” the letter said.The self-described “grassroots conservative activists” said they plan to keep their options open, allowing the possibility of a contested convention and a third-party candidacy. Some of the nation’s most prominent conservatives, Erickson included, have for months harbored doubts about Trump’s campaign, citing his pledge not to reform Social Security or Medicare and his past support for Democrats as betrayals of core conservative values. Until recently, the GOP establishment said little, believing Trump would flame out on his own. But facing the dire prospect of Trump atop the GOP ticket in November, conservatives are finally beginning to organize their opposition in public.“We encourage all former Republican candidates not currently supporting Trump to unite against him and encourage all candidates to hold their delegates on the first ballot,” the statement read, referring to a tactic to deny Trump the nomination at the party convention.The statement also alluded to the possibility of multiple rounds of ballots at the Republican National Convention in July. Trump recently warned of the possibility of riots at the convention if he were to be denied the nomination. “The process should be good enough for all the candidates without threats of riots,” the letter said. It also left open the possibility of a third party candidate, a “real conservative,” and referred to Trump as a “Hillary Clinton donor,” The prospect of the remaining GOP candidates dropping their opposition and uniting against Trump is difficult to imagine, given the current state of the GOP. Besides Trump, the two candidates remaining in the presidential race, Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have little in common and have attacked one another in recent debates.Two other former Republican presidential contenders have endorsed Trump: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. As of Friday afternoon, Trump had a delegate lead of 262 over Cruz, with 673 delegates won to Cruz’s 411. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that Brian Darling attended the meeting at the Army Navy Club. In fact, he was not in attendance."
Ted Cruz’s New Adviser Is Even More Anti-Muslim Than Donald Trump,3778,"WASHINGTON — A big part of Sen. Ted Cruz’s appeal is that he’s not Donald Trump, the openly bigoted billionaire currently leading the Republican Party’s presidential race.But the notion that a Cruz presidency would be more palatable to those concerned about Trump’s anti-Muslim stance came into doubt on Thursday, when Cruz unveiled his own team of national security advisers. It includes Frank Gaffney, a man described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “one of America’s most notorious Islamophobes.”Gaffney, who served in the Reagan-era Defense Department, now heads the Center for Security Policy. It’s a think tank of sorts well known for promoting conspiratorial theories about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating the U.S. government at high levels and the Sharia system replacing American democracy.Well aware that he is not the GOP establishment’s favorite, Cruz has been urging primary voters to see him as the most likely candidate to beat Trump. But it’s not clear that the Texas senator offers much of an alternative to Trump’s offensive rhetoric. When Trump proposed banning all Muslims from entering the U.S. in December, Cruz said he disagreed with the idea, but he refused to criticize Trump and said, “I understand why Donald made that proposal.”Now Cruz is enlisting the help of Gaffney, the same man who created a bogus survey claiming to show that many U.S. Muslims were willing to use violence against other Americans and that even more wanted the option to be governed by Sharia. Trump later used that survey as justification for a Muslim ban.Here are some of the more outrageous claims made by Cruz’s new foreign policy adviser: In the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, Gaffney suggested that then-President Saddam Hussein had been involved in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, committed by Timothy McVeigh.When President Barack Obama nominated Elena Kagan to serve on the Supreme Court in 2010, Gaffney accused her of being soft on Sharia during her time as dean of Harvard Law School. His group financed an ad that asked, “If Kagan tolerates promoting the injustice of Sharia law on the campus of Harvard, what kind of injustice will she tolerate in America during a lifetime on the Supreme Court?” In 2009, Gaffney questioned whether Obama was America’s first Muslim president or simply playing one. “The man now happy to have his Islamic-rooted middle name featured prominently has engaged in the most consequential bait-and-switch since Adolf Hitler duped Neville Chamberlain over Czechoslovakia at Munich,” Gaffney wrote.In 2010, Gaffney accused Obama of dismantling American missile defense capability in an act of U.S. submission to Islam. He cited a “new” Missile Defense Agency logo as evidence, suggesting that the logo appeared to be a combination of Obama’s campaign symbol and the Islamic crescent and star. He later corrected that post, acknowledging that the logo was neither new nor produced under Obama’s direction. (Below see the older logo on the left, which the Missile Defense Agency still uses as well, and the newer logo on the right.)Gaffney suggested that Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the time, was submitting to Sharia when Petraeus condemned the burning of a Quran by a Florida pastor.Gaffney has accused a bipartisan array of political elites of being secretly tied to the Islamist organization known as the Muslim Brotherhood, including longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and conservative heavyweights Grover Norquist and Suhail Khan.Gaffney has objected to Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Andre Carson (D-Ind.) serving on the House Intelligence Committee because they are Muslim and therefore, he said, likely to leak information to the Muslim Brotherhood.While the rest of the world marveled at the ignorance that led authorities in Irving, Texas, to mistake 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed’s homemade clock for a bomb last year, Gaffney wrote that the school did the right thing by suspending Ahmed and calling the police. His group later honored Beth Van Duyne, the mayor of Irving and a Sharia alarmist, with the Freedom Flame Award for her “efforts to protect the Constitution.”Gaffney hosted white nationalist Jared Taylor on his radio show last fall and praised Taylor’s American Renaissance website as “wonderful.” During the show, Taylor challenged the idea that the desperate people now flooding into Europe are refugees, calling that description a myth “touted by liberals.” When asked about the consequences of these individuals moving to Europe, Taylor said, “We have unleashed now what would not be an exaggeration to call almost demonic forces.”When Trump proposed a ban on Muslims’ entry into the U.S last year, Gaffney quickly jumped to his defense. “Mr. Trump has clearly picked up on a conviction increasingly shared by millions of Americans,” he wrote on his group’s website. “They have begun to see the Obama administration has long been downplaying, misrepresenting and mishandling a threat more and more of us see plainly.”When Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) invited Broward County Deputy Sheriff Nazar Hamze to this year’s State of the Union address, Gaffney accused Hamze of being “tied to a group that is directly linked to Hamas.” He was referring to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based advocacy group.Gaffney accused Pope Francis of having “rabidly anti-American” views after the pope said in February that it’s “not Christian” to urge the deportation of undocumented immigrants and vow to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.A few years ago, it looked as though the Republican Party was ready to sever ties with Gaffney and his inflammatory claims. He was banned from the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011 after accusing Norquist and Khan of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.But since then, Gaffney has staged a comeback. GOP presidential hopefuls Cruz, Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee all appeared at his group’s events last year. Months ago, Cruz offered the following praise for the zealot: “Frank is a patriot, he loves this country, and he’s clear-eyed about radical Islamic terrorism.”Cruz may actually believe Gaffney’s conspiracy theories or he may be making a strategic calculation to link himself with Gaffney in an effort to win over some of Trump’s supporters. Either way, it shows the Republican Party’s willingness to embrace Islamophobia and its most vocal adherents. "
How To Explain Hillary Clinton’s Fundraiser With Failed Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes,1778,"[UPDATE, 3/19: Since this piece was published, the Clinton campaign had an outbreak of good sense and will no longer be fundraising with Theranos.] So, that happened. Elizabeth Holmes is the young, fresh-faced CEO of Theranos, a medical device startup that promised to revolutionize the science of blood testing with cutting-edge technology. But there’s a problem. Last October, the Wall Street Journal reported that Theranos wasn’t delivering anything close to what it promised. In the months since, the company has become synonymous with corporate excess — serial violators of lab standards and federal regulations that posed “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.”So, why is Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton having a fundraiser with Holmes next week? The choice seems inexplicable — unless you’ve read Thomas Frank’s new book, Listen Liberal: or Whatever Happened To The Party of the People. Frank joined the “So That Happened” podcast to discuss his new tome.To understand how it came to pass that Clinton would authorize Holmes to be a fundraising stand-in for her campaign, you need to be aware of how the Democratic party has evolved over the past few decades — an evolution that Frank rather eloquently documents in his book. “At some point,” Frank tells the Huffington Post, “[the Democrats] decided that they weren’t all that interested in the concerns of working people anymore.” Rather, Frank says, they became fixated on “the concerns of the professional class, people with advanced degrees, people at the very top of our economic society.”Essentially, the Democratic party lives in a meritocratic bubble, where credentials, advanced degrees, media savviness, and — above all — wealth, are treated as de facto evidence of authority and expertise. This is how the Democratic party has rationalized participating in the school reform movement: to meritocrats, it makes perfect sense to believe that a successful CEO would know more about how to run a school system than actual teachers.And once you’ve made it into this coterie of elites, it becomes all too easy to forgive them for their occasional transgressions. The failures of Theranos don’t stick to Holmes (indeed, the media continued to fawn over Holmes after the Wall Street Journal blew up her spot). If anything, these setbacks are temporary embarrassments on the way to success. Class recognizes class.Frank says that Clinton is “a perfect example of the kind of liberal I talk about,” steeped in the “belief in meritocracy that’s going to solve all things” and the regular “palling around with billionaires.”“When you listen to her talk,” Frank says, “when she’s not trying to steal Bernie Sanders’ talking points and actually speaking her own mind, she gravitates back to meritocracy almost automatically.”And Clinton has gravitated toward Holmes because the Theranos CEO represents something specific. Throughout the campaign, Clinton has described her candidacy as one that would “break down barriers.” This is the essential aspect of her response to income inequality: rather than repair a rigged system or make the capital-to-labor ratio more equitable through policy, she wants to bring a greater amount of diversity to the meritocratic class, with benefits sure to trickle down.Holmes, as a female CEO in the male-dominated culture of tech startups, thus represents the very model of a barrier-breaker. Concerns about the quality of her leadership and her company’s work are secondary.Asked whether the recent news of the Holmes fundraiser represented a good explication of his book’s thesis, Frank says, “That’s almost too perfect. One of the problems of writing this book is that I wanted to see this kind of thing in action. But in order to do that, you have to give money.” Elsewhere on this week’s podcast: This week, President Barack Obama picked Judge Merrick Garland to fill Antonin Scalia’s vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Naturally, his pick has touched off another round of politicking between the White House and the Senate Republicans who have vowed to not consider a Supreme Court nominee, but more to the point: Who is Merrick Garland, and why?Meanwhile, the 2016 races continue, and a sense of inevitability is beginning to set in. Bernie Sanders failed to pull off the upsets he needed on this past Super Tuesday’s primaries, leaving him now in need of a miracle finish to pull off the nomination. Meanwhile, the #NeverTrump League suffered a setback after Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) got waxed in his home state. We’ll set the stage for what happens next. Finally, Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) is back with us, talking about Donald Trump, government reform and his plans to travel to Cuba with President Barack Obama. He’ll talk about how after 60 years of isolation and embargo, it’s time for a change of course with the island nation.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week is author and journalist Thomas Frank, U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble and Huffington Post reporters Cristian Farias and Samantha Lachman.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

""I can see women not liking that.""Get Carol Roszka talking about why she does not want Hillary Clinton in the White House, and it is hard to get her to stop. Roszka vents about how Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi attacks was disgraceful, her feminism is phony and her ambition is off-putting.“She wants to be elected at all costs,” said Roszka, a 63-year-old from suburban Detroit who often votes Republican, as she did in last week’s primary.Yet Roszka says when she votes in November, it will very likely be for Clinton.Election 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | March 15 election results | Track the delegate race | Sign up for the newsletter  Donald Trump has driven her to it. “I do not want Trump under any circumstances,” she said of the New York billionaire who looks headed to appear on the ballot alongside Clinton, after both candidates won a round of key states Tuesday. “So much so that I will not vote for the Republican Party at all if he runs.”Roszka is part of what you might call Clinton’s coalition of the unwilling. They are the independent and moderate Republican women who don’t like Clinton – some even despise her – but are so repulsed by Trump that they are already preparing to vote for the Democrat they anticipate will be on the ballot in November if that’s what it takes to keep him out of office. Either that, or sit out the election altogether.First he went after “Little Marco” Rubio. Then he targeted “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz.Now as he faces a key test Tuesday in Ohio, a state that could ease his way to the Republican nomination or raise a significant hurdle, Donald Trump has turned his sights on its governor, presidential rival John Kasich.First he went after “Little Marco” Rubio. Then he targeted “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz.Now as he faces a key test Tuesday in Ohio, a state that could ease his way to the Republican nomination or raise a significant hurdle, Donald Trump has turned his sights on its governor, presidential rival John Kasich.This loose coalition is large and growing.More Republican women view Trump more negatively than positively, according to Gallup. And in a hypothetical matchup with Clinton, a Washington Post/ABC News poll found this month that Trump loses the women’s vote by 21 points. A taste of what Trump could expect as nominee came when an anti-Trump super PAC run by Republicans began airing an ad Monday titled “Real Donald Trump Quotes About Women.” Female actors read aloud such Trump remarks as his summation of former rival Carly Fiorina: “Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?”Trump’s problem with women has driven more than a few Republican strategists to warn that his name on the ticket in November would be a surefire path to their party’s defeat.“If the election is close and looks like Donald Trump could be president, there are Republican women who will say, ‘I can’t believe I am saying this, but I am going to vote for Hillary Clinton,’” said Christine Matthews, whose firm specializes in helping Republicans target women. The only other scenario she foresees with Trump on the ballot is those voters staying home because Clinton’s lead heading into election day is big enough to win without them having to commit the unconscionable act of voting for her.Trump’s strategy of hyper-targeting disaffected, white working-class men may be bringing new voters to the polls, but it is coming at a heavy cost, exacerbating the GOP’s chronic troubles luring female voters in presidential elections, according to Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster. Trump is taking an approach that is exactly the opposite of what the Republican Party’s famous “autopsy” report following Mitt Romney’s loss in 2012 advised: Adopt policies that are more inclusive to broaden the party’s base of support.“It is very dangerous math,” Anderson said of Trump’s strategy. “It is unlikely to pay off in the general election.”Trump is characteristically unconcerned.The unease this large swath of the electorate feels toward him, he says, will pass once he has locked in the nomination. With typical Trump bombast, he explains it in a way that many of those very women are sure to find insulting.“To be victorious, frankly, I had to be very tough,” he said on MSNBC last week, following electoral victories in Michigan and Mississippi. “I had to be very sharp and smart and nasty. And I can see women not necessarily liking the tone, but also I had to get to the finish line … I had to be harsh in order to win. I can see women not liking that. That will change.”Some Democrats warn not to discount such vows, as Trump has proven masterful at adapting to the contours of the race. “Donald has surprised everybody at every step of the way,” said Ed Rendell, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee.For a lot of women, though, anxieties about Trump run much deeper than tone.“He’s sexist; he’s racist; he says things that will cause businesses to lose money,” said Roszka. “He wants to be king or emperor. He does not want to be president.”Kelly Grayburn, an occupational therapist in South Carolina, recoiled when asked what she will do if Trump is on the ballot in November. “I can’t even say the words,” said Grayburn, a Marco Rubio supporter, before bringing her voice to a whisper. “I would seriously consider voting for Hillary.”Another South Carolina Republican voter, Cindy Hipszer, said she would need divine intervention to guide her on how to vote if, heaven forbid, Trump is on the November ballot. Her plan: “Pray hard. … Be on our knees for days.”Not all women share that view. Millions will have voted for Trump by the time the Republican primary ends, many of them drawn by his tough line on immigration, his repudiation of international trade deals, his hawkish talk on national defense. They might agree with the billionaire that his off-color remarks about women, his disparagement of Mexican immigrants and his warnings about Muslims are not the words of a misogynist, racist and xenophobe but of a truth talker who will not be bound by political correctness.“This is the first time I’ve felt excited about a presidential candidate since Reagan,” said Kimberly Dial, an employment agency owner who organized an event for Trump supporters recently at a gun range in McDonough, Ga. “He speaks his mind. He’s not politically correct ... not worried about who he offends.”A flammable brew of populist anger, a candidate's provocative remarks and disruptive protesters found a fuse, and the result, at what was to be a Donald Trump event in Chicago this weekend, was an explosion that continued to reverberate through the presidential campaign Saturday.In a contest that...A flammable brew of populist anger, a candidate's provocative remarks and disruptive protesters found a fuse, and the result, at what was to be a Donald Trump event in Chicago this weekend, was an explosion that continued to reverberate through the presidential campaign Saturday.In a contest that...Trump’s problem is that so many more women find him problematic than inspiring. When a Washington Post/ABC News poll recently explored how Republican women would vote if the primary were winnowed down to Trump and just one other rival, barely any of the women not already aligned with Trump picked him.“I don’t think there is a lot of middle ground about Donald Trump,” said Matthews. “Voters have pretty much figured out if he is somebody they support and could support or not at this point.” That does not bode well if Trump plans to ease off in the general election from some of the many things he has said in recent months – and years – that have women expressing more anxiety about him than any major party front-runner in recent memory.“There is so much out there in terms of things he has said, or tweeted or done not only in this campaign but before now that I think women might find particularly disturbing,” said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “These things can be brought out against him, and they are not going to go away.”They will target voters like Margot Kahl, a supporter of Sen. Ted Cruz in Michigan deeply unsettled by the prospect of Trump being the Republican choice in November. “If Donald Trump would win, I don’t know what would happen to our world,” she said.Halper reported from Grosse Point Woods and Mascaro from Columbia, S.C.evan.halper@latimes.com | @evanhalperlisa.mascaro@latimes.com | @lisamascaroMORE CAMPAIGN NEWSRubio lost because of Rubio: 5 takeaways from Tuesday's primariesDonald Trump's primary romp boosts another candidate: Hillary ClintonCalifornia's June primary just became crucial in the race for the White House"
John Kasich Finds A Reason To Sternly Chide Donald Trump,642,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich stepped gingerly toward condemning rival candidate Donald Trump on Thursday. The comment that went too far for Kasich: the real estate mogul’s warning of “riots” later this summer if GOP officials move to deny him the nomination.In a series of tweets signed “John,” Kasich chided the GOP presidential front-runner for using “unacceptable language.”On Wednesday, Trump warned of “riots” at the Republican National Convention in July if he arrives with fewer than the required number of delegates to clinch the nomination, but still more than his rivals have, and doesn’t get the party’s nod.“If you disenfranchise those people, and you say, ‘Well, I’m sorry, but you’re 100 votes short,’ even though the next one is 500 votes short, I think you would have problems like you’ve never seen before. I think bad things would happen,” Trump said. “I wouldn’t lead it, but I think bad things would happen.”Kasich has attempted to draw a contrast between himself and his mud-slinging rivals by giving his candidacy a sunny, positive tone. While taking issue with the Trump campaign’s “toxic atmosphere,” he has largely refrained from criticizing Trump the man. Kasich has dodged questions over Trump’s fitness for the presidency in TV interviews and has stuck by his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee even if that person is Trump.The strategy has had some success: On Tuesday, Kasich won his home state’s GOP primary.Editor’s note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"

And out of concern that a Republican president in 2017 — either Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) — would weaken or reverse some of his landmark policies, Obama and his surrogates have started making the case that it is essential for the GOP to be defeated in November.As a result, Obama is poised to be the most active sitting president on the campaign trail in decades.“Do we continue to build on the policies that reward hard-working American families .?.?. and address challenges for future generations, or do we stop in our tracks, reverse our progress and move in the wrong direction?” Friedman wrote. “This is a choice that the president does not take lightly, and is something he will lay out for the American people with increased frequency in the weeks and months ahead.” Central to the White House effort to stop Trump — or, under a less likely scenario, one of his rivals — is reassembling and energizing the coalition that propelled Obama into office; that means African Americans, Latinos, young voters and women.Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Austin on Friday, Obama said that consolidating the gains that Democrats have made over the course of his presidency will depend on ensuring that people are “engaged and working just as hard and just as full of hope as they did in 2008.”One big worry for Democrats is the level of enthusiasm among the party’s base when Obama is no longer on the ballot.“There’s a tendency, in the third election in a row for a party, for there to be some sense of complacency,” said former White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer. What Democrats need to do in the coming months is clear, he said: “The difference between Donald Trump winning or losing is whether Obama’s 2008 coalition turns out in 2016.”Many Democrats think that if Trump is the GOP nominee, he will help the Democratic Party solve the mobilization problem. They think that Trump’s strident anti-immigrant positions and his controversial comments about women and minorities will help Democrats in the fall.Latino voters, especially, are receiving the attention of advocacy groups, including super PACs friendly to the Clinton campaign and to Democrats in general.Liberal investor George Soros is among the backers helping to amass about $15 million for a super PAC devoted to increasing the participation of Latino voters as well as African Americans and women.Vice President Biden, for his part, is preparing to campaign heavily in the Rust Belt to appeal to the white, working-class voters who may be drawn to Trump, according to aides. [Pro-Clinton Super PAC mocks Trump in new video] Democratic Party officials say they are taking the threat of a Trump nomination seriously and plan to begin attacking him immediately, on policy and on his temperament. They also vow not to make the mistakes that Trump’s GOP opponents made early in the primary season. They are not assuming that the billionaire real estate magnate will self-destruct, they say.“We’re ready for Donald Trump,” DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz told reporters Wednesday. “We’re not treating him like the laughingstock that Republican establishment folks treated him for far too long.”Obama in recent days has been in the forefront of those viewing Trump as a serious electoral threat. More than once, the president has gone on extended riffs about why he thinks Trump as a political leader is bad for the country. “The best leaders, the leaders who are worthy of our votes, remind us that even in a country as big and diverse and inclusive as ours, what we’ve got in common is far more important than what divides any of us,” he said in Dallas last Saturday, just as reports about violence at Trump rallies were dominating the news.Increasingly, Obama has been using Trump’s candidacy to talk about what kind of country the United States is becoming. At a St. Patrick’s Day luncheon at the Capitol on Tuesday, Obama again alluded to Trump’s harsh campaign rhetoric.“In America, there aren’t laws that say that we have to be nice to each other, or courteous, or treat each other with respect. But there are norms. There are customs,” he said. “The longer that we allow the political rhetoric of late to continue, and the longer that we tacitly accept it, we create a permission structure that allows the animosity in one corner of our politics to infect our broader society. And animosity breeds animosity.” Clearly, once there is a Democratic nominee, who Obama advisers say they expect will be Clinton, the president will hit the campaign trail on that nominee’s behalf. Obama and Biden recently endorsed two Democrats involved in contested Senate primaries, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland and U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy (Fla.), and on Thursday they endorsed former senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) in his bid to retake his seat.   politicsLocal Politics AlertsBreaking news about local government in D.C., Md., Va.Please provide a valid email address.  Republican national spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in an email that Obama will be “a huge liability” in swing states because he has “job approval numbers that continue to struggle.”“An overwhelming majority of the people want a different approach than Obama,” Walters wrote. “Polls show Americans are tired of the status quo and want to take our country in a new direction.”Democrats, by contrast, think the key to winning this year is, in the words of one party strategist, “more about mobilizing your own voters than persuading some rapidly shrinking middle.”In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, Obama had an overall approval rating of 51 percent, but his approval was 87 percent among Democrats, 67 percent among voters under 30 and 75 percent among Hispanics. He regularly polls at 90 percent among African Americans.

Paul Ryan Doesn’t Think He’ll Have To Denounce Donald Trump,452,"House Speaker Paul Ryan has condemned Donald Trump’s outrageous comments twice now — once after the real estate mogul called for a Muslim ban and once after he failed to adequately distance himself from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. But the Wisconsin Republican said on Thursday that he doesn’t think he’ll have to denounce Trump’s entire candidacy.“I do not believe I’ll have to do that,” Ryan told reporters at his weekly press conference. The speaker didn’t clarify whether he thinks he won’t have to disavow Trump because the would-be nominee will be on his best behavior, or because he doesn’t think Trump will be the nominee.When a reporter pressed Ryan, saying he has already “denounced Donald Trump for xenophobia and Islamaphobia,” Ryan playfully shrugged as if to say, “Well, yes and no.”Ryan has yet to use Trump’s name in one of his condemnations, opting instead for nebulous statements about what conservatism really is and what it is not. But it’s clear that Ryan has been referring to the GOP front-runner, even if Trump himself doesn’t seem to be getting the message.When discussing how he’ll unite the party during his victory speech on Tuesday, Trump noted that “Paul Ryan called me — tremendous call.”Privately, sources have told The Huffington Post that Ryan is struggling with how to deal with Trump. Publicly, however, Ryan notes he’s the chairman of the GOP nominating convention in July and says it would therefore be inappropriate for him to endorse — or denounce — any of the candidates.Still, Democrats are doing their best to connect Ryan and the rest of the GOP conference with the GOP front-runner. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently sent Ryan a “Trump Starter Kit,” complete with a copy of The Art of the Deal, the first season of “The Apprentice” and some antacid.But the true sources of Ryan’s heartburn are Trump’s often-appalling comments condoning violence at his rallies, stoking fear and racism, and denigrating women.Ryan still seems to be holding out hope that Trump won’t be the nominee, and that he won’t have to reconsider his “I’ll support whoever our nominee is“ pledge.On Thursday, Ryan, who two months ago said it was “ridiculous“ for the press to suggest there could be a brokered Republican convention, seemed to acknowledge that a contested vote in Cleveland was a distinct possibility.Ryan said the GOP nomination was a democratic process, and if a candidate doesn’t receive “sufficient delegates, then it goes to the convention, and the delegates make that decision.”Ryan noted that those delegates were themselves elected by Republicans, and said he plans to respect the process and not say whom the GOP nominee should be.But he did add that he has a responsibility to speak out if anybody — “not just Donald Trump” — is misrepresenting the Republican party or “disfiguring conservatism,” and said he would continue to do that.One thing Ryan was quite definitive about, however, was speculation that he might run for the White House himself. He recently responded “we’ll see“ when asked about running in a contested convention, and former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) recently said he’d like Ryan to become the nominee in a brokered convention as well. Speaking about the idea on Tuesday, Ryan was about as Shermanesque as a potential future candidate for the presidency can get.“It’s not going to be me. It should be somebody running for president,” he said, adding that he wanted to “put this thing to rest and move on.”“I saw Boehner last night, and I told him to knock it off,” he said, noting that he used slightly different words that were a bit more John Boehner-ish and almost certainly saltier.Share this slide:"
"Donald Trump Poses As Big A Risk To Global Stability As Terrorism, Report Says",3960,"The rising threat of jihadi terrorism, a military clash over China’s expansionism in the South China Sea, and Donald Trump as president — one of these things is not like the others, and it’s not the one you’d expect. According to a report published by The Economist Intelligence Unit on Thursday, the prospect of conflict in the South China Sea poses a lesser risk to the world’s economic stability than the other two threats.Yes — that means the EIU, a research and analysis group associated with The Economist magazine, believes a Trump presidency would be just as risky as the threat of jihadi terrorism. Both threats are tied at sixth place on a list of the world’s top 10 biggest risks to the global economy. (The possibility of a hard Chinese economic crash ranked first and a renewed cold war ranked second. Meanwhile, a clash in the South China Sea tied for eighth with a U.K. vote to leave the European Union.)The EIU’s report calculates risk intensity on a 25-point scale, taking into account both the probability that an event will occur and the impact it will have if it comes to pass.The prospect of Trump winning the U.S. presidential election and the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilizing the global economy are both “high impact” threats that have a “moderate probability” of occurring, according to the EIU.“In the event of a Trump victory, his hostile attitude to free trade, and alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate rapidly into a trade war,” the analysis notes. “His militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East (and ban on all Muslim travel to the US) would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups, increasing their threat both within the region and beyond.”The EIU further condemned the presidential candidate for his “exceptionally right-wing stance on the Middle East and jihadi terrorism, including, among other things, advocating the killing of families of terrorists and launching a land incursion into Syria to wipe out IS (and acquire its oil).”The report says it’s doubtful that Trump will defeat his likely Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, but concedes that it isn’t impossible.Should Trump win the presidency, the report predicts that “virulent” opposition from Democrats and the Republican establishment would limit his ability to pass more radical policies, but warns that “such internal bickering will also undermine the coherence of domestic and foreign policymaking.”Here’s the full list of global threats from the EIU report:Editor’s note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Share this slide:"
Harry Reid: The GOP’s ‘Big Lie’ Gave Rise To Donald Trump,2894,"WASHINGTON — Republicans have only themselves to blame for Donald Trump’s rise, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) argued Thursday, declaring if Trump wins the White House, Mexico will build his infamous wall — to keep Americans out.Republicans have created the toxic environment in which Trump can insult immigrants, black people, Muslims and just anybody else by spending the last seven years spinning what he called the “big lie.”“Again and again, Republican leaders told Americans that any policy put forward by Democrats was nefarious simply because it came from President Obama,” Reid said.That extended even to Republican ideas, if Democrats embraced them, and the effort to maintain the lie with conservative voters took the GOP into dark places, Reid said.“Like any lie, maintaining this one took Republicans deeper and deeper into dishonesty,” he said. “Republicans soon found that propping up the lie meant they had to question any independent authority that might contradict it. So they started routinely questioning science, statistics and any other independent research that supported Democratic policies.”It created an environment where many Republicans believe things that simply are not true, such as the idea that unemployment has gone up under Obama, rather than declined to 4.9 percent in the most recent data.“So what thrived in the wasteland Republican leaders created?” Reid asked. “Resentment and hatred, which Republican leaders were all too eager to embrace and too cowardly to renounce.”GOP leaders made things worse by repeatedly failing to reject such obvious falsehoods, and even dabbling in the phenomenon that Trump championed: questioning whether Obama was even really an American.“Republicans in Congress did nothing to quell this blatant lie,” Reid said. “Republicans in the House introduced legislation suggesting that our president wasn’t born in America. And who was the most prominent Republican to give the birther movement a platform? Donald Trump.”That has all led to the point where the Grand Old Party finds itself today — aghast at the prospect of a Trump nomination even as it continues its behavior toward Obama, making the unprecedented decision to not even weigh his Supreme Court appointee.“If [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and [House Speaker Paul] Ryan think that Donald Trump’s racist, xenophobic demagoguery is wrong, they should not support him — period,” Reid said.“If they refuse to revoke their support for Trump, they should both put on ‘Make America Great Again’ hats, and stand behind Trump at his next press conference. Be a mini-Christie, I guess,” he said, referring to the uncomfortable appearances of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) on the campaign trail with Trump.Reid’s punch line was that if the toxic environment sown by Republicans sprouts a Trump presidency, at least one of the real estate developer’s unlikely campaign promises will come true.“He may be right about the Mexicans building a wall and paying for it themselves, because if he’s elected, they’ll build one to keep us from going into Mexico,” Reid said. “They’ll be happy to do that.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
